## Overview

TheChels ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our apps and extensions.

## Information We Collect

- None. All our apps and extensions are designed with a privacy-first approach, meaning we do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or usage data. We don't have any servers or databases that store user data.

- All data is processed locally on your device or iCloud, ensuring complete privacy and control over your content.

## How We Use Information

- Since we don't collect personal information, we cannot use it. All processing happens locally on your device.

## Third-Party Services

None of our apps integrate with or share data with any third-party services. The app operates entirely offline after installation, or uses iCloud for storage, which is managed by Apple.

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since no data is collected, COPPA compliance is inherent in our design.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal data:

- There is no data to access, modify, or delete
- No data portability is needed as everything stays on your device
- You maintain complete control over your information
