**Last updated:** _June 9, 2025_

## Overview

TheChels ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our apps and extensions.

## Information We Collect

### Information We Don't Collect

- **Personal Data**: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information
- **Usage Analytics**: We do not track your usage patterns or behaviour
- **Account Information**: No account creation or login is required
- **Content Data**: Your markdown content and Jekyll posts remain entirely in your iCloud drive or local device.

### Local Storage Only

- All your data is stored locally on your device
- Settings and preferences are saved in your browser's local storage (Chrome extension) or iCloud (iOS app)
- No data is transmitted to our servers or any third-party services

## How We Use Information

Since we don't collect personal information, we cannot use it. All processing happens locally on your device:

- Markdown generation and formatting
- Jekyll front matter creation
- Content preview and editing

## Data Security

- **Local Processing**: All operations are performed locally on your device
- **No Server Communication**: The app does not communicate with external servers
- **No Data Transmission**: Your content never leaves your device or iCloud drive
- **Device Security**: Your data security depends on your device's security measures

## Third-Party Services

Hyd does not integrate with or share data with any third-party services. The app operates entirely offline after installation.

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since no data is collected, COPPA compliance is inherent in our design.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.

## Contact Us

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal data:

- There is no data to access, modify, or delete
- No data portability is needed as everything stays on your device
- You maintain complete control over your information

This privacy-first approach ensures your content and usage patterns remain completely private and under your control.
