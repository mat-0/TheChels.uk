Drafts is a Mac and [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1236254471?ls=1&mt=8&at=11l4Cf&ct=site) made by [Agile Tortoise](https://getdrafts.com). The app supports custom actions and scripts written in JavaScript, here is a list of actions I have created.

- [Deduplicate list](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/21k) _makes list items unique and appends deleted items in a new list at the bottom of the draft._
- [Sort lists](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/21h) _Takes all the lists in a draft and sorts the list items alphabetically within each list._
- [TimeZones](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/21g) _Takes a 24h time in the UK (23:45) at the start of a draft and appends a list of common time zones across the world._
- [Line Quotes](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/21f) _Takes a draft and prepends a `>` at the start of each line._
- [Sum Lists](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/21e) _Takes a list of items and costs and creates a new line showing the total._
- [Quote post](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/21d) _Takes a quote post, asks for Front Matter, and saves it into Working Copy._
- [Regular Post](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/21c) _Takes a regular blog post, asks for Title and date, and saves it to Working Copy._
- [Front-mattered Post](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/21i) _Takes a Jekyll formatted post with front matter and copies it to Working Copy._
- [Header Date](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/21m) _adds today's date as a h3 heading - perfect for journalling._
- [Get weather](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/21n) _using OpenWeather's 2.5 API (your own key required) and a city/location added as credentials to produce a date header and list of metrics for the forecast._
