This page serves as the system of record for my online identity. The best places to follow me are:

- Here on this website [rss](/feed)
- [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mat-benfield/)

I own and control the domain thechels.uk and the-ensemblist.uk

My email address are ensemblist.uk@gmail.com I have a [PGP](/pgp) key.

If there's an account claiming to be me that's not on this list, it's almost certainly an impersonator. My presence on the web is limited.
