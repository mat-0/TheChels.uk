This page serves as the system of record for my online identity. The best places to follow me are:

- Here on this website [RSS](/feed)
- [LinkedIn &raquo;](https://www.linkedin.com/in/0Mat/)
- [GitHub &#11084;](https://github.com/Mat-0/)

- [Keybase &#11084;](https://keybase.io/thechelsuk)

I own and control this domain thechels.uk and hiyd.uk

I have a [PGP](/pgp) key for keybase.io/thechelsuk and you can verify my identity there.

If there's an account claiming to be me that's not on this list, it's almost certainly an impersonator.

My presence on the web is limited so its incredibly likely similarly named people will exist on the usual social sites.
