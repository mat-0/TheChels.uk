- [Cheltenham Open Data](https://cheltenham-open-data.github.io) - A GitHub project to collect and disseminate public open data from a variety of sources, created during the covid pandemic and lockdown 2020. The project pulls together terrorism ratings, food-bank data, flood warnings and covid data (now archived). The main requirement was to just republish exciting data as RSS feeds (xml).

- [Boinc](https://boinc.thechels.uk) - Hosting a web page for a friend; BOINC is a platform that allows computers all round the world to contribute their spare computing capacity to run distributed applications. Several of those involved with TheChels.org contribute their computers in such a way.

  Distributed applications are largely run by Universities to research fields such as Biology & Medicine, Earth Sciences, Mathematics or Physics & Astronomy. To cut a very long story short, there are two projects we'd like to talk about; Rosetta and World Community Grid.

- [SecOpsNews](https://github.com/SecOpsNews/news) - RSS items as GitHub Issues for the discerning engineering leader or security professional. A repository to track and publish third party (RSS) feeds from various security sites as GitHub issues. Note this is quite noisy but seems well liked with 47 stars on GitHub


- [Tools](https://tools.thechels.uk) - A digital playground or smorgasbord of ad-hoc and occasional tooling, including converting file types, charting, and string manipulations.
