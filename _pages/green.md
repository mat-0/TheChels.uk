## Energy

- 10 Solar Panels and a 5kw battery helps reduce reliance on the grid
- Energy provider uses green energy.
- 95% of home uses smart energy efficient lighting. Remaining is due to be addressed in 2025

## Transport

- Own an EV (as a gift to my spouse) but have never been learned to drive so all commuting has been via public transport.

## Recycling

- Actively seek to recycle waste products. As a household we rarely fill the refuse waste, but do fill the recycling boxes for card, glass, and foil and plastics.
- We also recycle coffee pods and contact lenses and give plenty to charity as well as shop there often.

## Garden

 - The small garden is allowed to grow in spring and we delay the first cut of the lawn to allow for pollinators to benefit.
 - An area of the garden is set up for wild flowers.
 - We have grown a mixture of fruit and vegetables including apples, blackberries, rhubarb, strawberries, potatoes, carrots, parsnips and radishes.
