Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), the site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator, on [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). DNS and SSL by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com). It also uses GitHub actions, GitHub issues, and some [Python](https://www.python.org) for automation.

It is called "weak notes" as a play on words of the popular Government "[week](https://promo.cymru/resource/weeknotes/) [notes](https://weeknot.es)" blogging style - due to the likelihood, posting will be inconsistent and irregular, and having worked adjacent to Government for 14 years.

The font-family utilises the user's operating system setting via the `-system-ui` declaration, `Gill Sans` if available, and as a last resort falls back to `sans-serif`. The primary colour scheme is `White Smoke` as the background, `Night` for text, `Brunswick Green` for links, `Lapis Lazuli` for some additional/secondary text e.g., post meta data and sub headings, and finally `Citron` is used for accents e.g., borders, separators, quote bars, and whimsy.

## In The Press

During an era of running a successful football analytics website I had work published on the Chelsea FC website, [FourFourTwo](https://thechels.uk/fourfourtwo-cult-heroes) [magazine](https://thechels.uk/fourfourtwo-chelsea-vs-swansea), [Man City's match day programme](https://thechels.uk/man-city-programme), the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2282976/Frank-Lampard-scores-200th-Chelsea-goal.html), the [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/valencia-penalty-gary-neville-chelsea-under19s-uefa-youth-league-a6892926.html) and various club fan sites including Crystal Palace, Walsall, Swansea snd Man City.

The associated Twitter account, active from 2010 to 2018, peaked at 185,000 followers with a monthly reach of 8 million users worldwide all through organic growth and received acclaim from Opta Sports, Chelsea FC, BBC and ofher businesses. The account was closed due to twiiter's new ownership. whilst noting footbal statistics had become more mainstream and access to data was less readily available.

## Now

_based on the "now" page idea from Derek Sivers._

* Surviving. I continue to fight with an undiagnosed fatigue that's been ongoing since October 2022
* Reading kindle books - I have a huge backlog to get through
* Household improvements - a heat pump, new carpets, doors and a new kitchen are all on the cards for 2025.
* Gardening - tending to the veggie patch and planters.
