It is called "weak notes" as a play on words of the popular Government "[week](https://promo.cymru/resource/weeknotes/) [notes](https://weeknot.es)" blogging style - due to the likelihood, posting will be inconsistent and irregular, and having worked adjacent to Government for 14 years.

The primary colour scheme is `White Smoke` as the background, `Night` for text, `Brunswick Green` for links, `Lapis Lazuli` for some additional/secondary text e.g., post meta data and sub headings, and finally `Citron` is used for accents e.g., borders, separators, quote bars, and whimsy.

## In The Press

During an era of running a successful football analytics website I had work published on the Chelsea FC website, [FourFourTwo](https://thechels.uk/fourfourtwo-cult-heroes) [magazine](https://thechels.uk/fourfourtwo-chelsea-vs-swansea), [Man City's match day programme](https://thechels.uk/man-city-programme), the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2282976/Frank-Lampard-scores-200th-Chelsea-goal.html), the [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/valencia-penalty-gary-neville-chelsea-under19s-uefa-youth-league-a6892926.html) and various club fan sites including [Crystal Palace](https://theeaglesbeak.com/2014/08/08/view-from-the-opposition-part-1/), [Walsall](https://walsall.vitalfootball.co.uk/chelsea-a-fans-view/), Swansea and Man City.

The associated Twitter account, active from 2010 to 2018, peaked at 185,000 followers with a monthly reach of 8 million users worldwide all through organic growth and received acclaim from Opta Sports, Chelsea FC, BBC and other businesses. The account was closed due to Twiiter's new ownership, whilst noting football statistics had become more mainstream and access to data had become less readily available.
