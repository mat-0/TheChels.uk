# Good Morning.

Morning, is a home page built daily at 5:00 UTC using github-actions, utilising python scripts to get the latest news, weather, sports fixtures, stocks, quotes, and other useful information.

## Prerequisites
In order for this solution to work you need to enter some secrets for the repo (or hard-code the values in the scripts if you don't care). There are also a bunch of config files (json) that need updating to suit your needs.

1. An open weather API key - you can register for a free account on their website.
2. Latitude and Longitude for the weather API.
3. Your city code e.g Bristol to work with the coronovirus API
4. Update websites.json with your list of website rss feeds you care about.
5. Update stocks.json with the ticker ids for the stocks.
6. Update tournaments.json with the list of competition slugs used by the BBC in order to get the relevant fixtures (its only football at this stage, as that is all I care about).
7. Update quotes.json with your favourite quotes.
