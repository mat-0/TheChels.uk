  description:
    "Football has always been a numbers game: 4-4-2, the big number 9,
    and 3 points for a win. But what if up until now we've been focusing on the wrong
    numbers? What if the numbers that really matter, the ones that hold the key to
    winning matches, are actually 2.66, 53.4,50/50 and 0 > 1? What if managers only
    make a 15 per cent difference? What if Chelsea should have bought Darren Bent?
    In this incisive, myth-busting book, Chris Anderson, former goalkeeper turned
    football-statistics guru, and David Sally, former baseball pitcher turned behavioural
    economist, show that every shred of knowledge we can gather can help us to love
    football and understand it even more. You'll discover why stopping a goal is more
    valuable than scoring one, why corners should be taken short, and why it is better
    to improve your worst player than to buy a superstar. 'Chris Anderson and David
    Sally have the ability to see football in a way few have before them. Be warned:
    The Numbers Game will change the way you think about your favourite team or player,
    and change the way you watch the beautiful game.' Billy Beane, General Manager
    of the Oakland A's, the subject of Moneyball 'A fascinating and stylish investigation
    into a rapidly developing way of understanding football.' Jonathan Wilson, author
    of Inverting the Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics"

  description:
    Whether it's Terry Venables keeping his wife up late at night with
    diagrams on scraps of paper spread over the eiderdown, or the classic TV sitcom
    of moving the salt & pepper around the table top in the transport cafe, football
    tactics are now part of the fabric of everyday life. Steve McLaren's switch to
    an untried 3-5-2 against Croatia will probably go down as the moment he lost his
    slim credibility gained from dropping David Beckham; Jose Mourinho, meanwhile,
    was often brought to task for trying to smuggle the long ball game back into English
    football. Here Jonathan Wilson pulls apart the modern game, traces the world history
    of tactics from modern pioneers right back to beginning where chaos reigned. Along
    the way he looks at the lives of great players and thinkers who shaped the game,
    and probes why the English, in particular, have 'proved themselves unwilling to
    grapple with the abstract'.

  description:
    “Brilliant, funny . . . the best math teacher you never had.”—San Francisco
    Chronicle Once considered tedious, the field of statistics is rapidly evolving
    into a discipline Hal Varian, chief economist at Google, has actually called “sexy.”
    From batting averages and political polls to game shows and medical research,
    the real-world application of statistics continues to grow by leaps and bounds.
    How can we catch schools that cheat on standardized tests? How does Netflix know
    which movies you’ll like? What is causing the rising incidence of autism? As best-selling
    author Charles Wheelan shows us in Naked Statistics, the right data and a few
    well-chosen statistical tools can help us answer these questions and more. For
    those who slept through Stats 101, this book is a lifesaver. Wheelan strips away
    the arcane and technical details and focuses on the underlying intuition that
    drives statistical analysis. He clarifies key concepts such as inference, correlation,
    and regression analysis, reveals how biased or careless parties can manipulate
    or misrepresent data, and shows us how brilliant and creative researchers are
    exploiting the valuable data from natural experiments to tackle thorny questions.
    And in Wheelan’s trademark style, there’s not a dull page in sight. You’ll encounter
    clever Schlitz Beer marketers leveraging basic probability, an International Sausage
    Festival illuminating the tenets of the central limit theorem, and a head-scratching
    choice from the famous game show Let’s Make a Deal—and you’ll come away with insights
    each time. With the wit, accessibility, and sheer fun that turned Naked Economics
    into a bestseller, Wheelan defies the odds yet again by bringing another essential,
    formerly unglamorous discipline to life.

    they try to understand the psychological origins of these behaviours and to work
    out how to help their client. The Coach's Casebook includes inspirational insights
    from individuals who have triumphed over such traits and have succeeded in all
    walks of life figures such as Alec Stewart and Lewis Moody from the world of sport,
    Greg Dyke from the world of business, and Arctic explorer Pen Hadow. This book
    is above all designed to help you in your work as a coach. It gives you practical,
    tried and tested techniques which you can use today to help your clients to change

    'The basics of being a ScrumMaster are fairly straightforward: At face

    impediments. But being a great ScrumMaster, one who truly embodies the principles
    of servant-leadership and helps move a team to the high performance levels possible
    with Scrum, is much harder and much more elusive. In this book Geoff shares a
    collection of stories and practical guidance, drawn from over ten years of coaching
    numerous Scrum teams that will guide you on your path to greatness. In this book
    you will learn: * The skills and characteristics of great ScrumMasters * How to
    generate, maintain and increase engagement from the team * How to increase the
    effectiveness of the Scrum meetings, such as retrospectives and daily scrums.
    * How to foster a more creative and collaborative team * How to increase the performance
    of the team * How to know when you are a successful ScrumMaster Scrum Mastery
    is for practicing ScrumMasters who want to develop themselves into a great servant-leader
    capable of taking their teams beyond simple process compliance. Mike Cohn, in
    his foreword for the book, said: "Most books rehash well-trod territory and I

  title: Hooked
  authors:
    - Nir Eyal
  publishedDate: "2014-11-04"
  description:
    "Revised and Updated, Featuring a New Case Study How do successful
    companies create products people can’t put down? Why do some products capture
    widespread attention while others flop? What makes us engage with certain products
    out of sheer habit? Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us? Nir
    Eyal answers these questions (and many more) by explaining the Hook Model—a four-step
    process embedded into the products of many successful companies to subtly encourage
    customer behavior. Through consecutive “hook cycles,” these products reach their
    ultimate goal of bringing users back again and again without depending on costly
    advertising or aggressive messaging. Hooked is based on Eyal’s years of research,
    consulting, and practical experience. He wrote the book he wished had been available
    to him as a start-up founder—not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building
    better products. Hooked is written for product managers, designers, marketers,
    start-up founders, and anyone who seeks to understand how products influence our
    behavior. Eyal provides readers with: • Practical insights to create user habits
    that stick. • Actionable steps for building products people love. • Fascinating
    examples from the iPhone to Twitter, Pinterest to the Bible App, and many other
    habit-forming products."

    never been able to think of herself as a 'runner', and the first time she forced

  description:
    "The old adage is ingrained in us that if you don't have anything nice
    to say then don't say anything at all. While this advice may work for home life,
    as Kim Scott has seen first hand, it is a disaster when adopted by managers in
    the work place.Scott earned her stripes as a highly successful manager at Google
    before moving to Apple where she developed a class on optimal management. Radical
    Candor draws directly on her experiences at these cutting edge companies to reveal
    a new approach to effective management that delivers huge success by inspiring
    teams to work better together by embracing fierce conversations.Radical Candor
    is the sweet spot between managers who are obnoxiously aggressive on the one side
    and ruinously empathetic on the other. It is about providing guidance, which involves
    a mix of praise as well as criticism - delivered to produce better results and
    help employees develop their skills and boundaries of success.Great bosses have
    a strong relationship with their employees, and Scott has identified three simple
    principles for building better relationships with your employees: make it personal,
    get stuff done, and understand why it matters.Radical Candor offers a guide to
    those bewildered or exhausted by management, written for bosses and those who
    manage bosses. Drawing on years of first hand experience, and distilled clearly
    to give actionable lessons to the reader, Radical Candor shows how to be successful
    while retaining your integrity and humanity. Radical Candor is the perfect handbook
    for those who are looking to find meaning in their job and create an environment
    where people both love their work, their colleagues and are motivated to strive
    to ever greater success."

    "The 1% Rule: How to Fall in Love with the Process and Achieve Your Wildest
    Dreams"
  authors:
    - Tommy Baker
  publishedDate: "2018-03-06"
  description:
    "In a highlight reel, microwave world — you're led to believe success
    is right around the corner: It's not working. Not only is it not working with
    your ability to achieve your goals, we've never been more frustrated, stuck, stressed
    and unfulfilled. Most personal development is all about the big and bold vision,
    yet these days we're not missing ambition or dreamers... We're missing results
    and execution. But what if there was a way to shut off the noise, fall in love
    with the process and take one step forward every single day as you paint your
    life's masterpiece? Enter The 1% Rule — a daily system designed to help you close
    the gap without the crushing pressure that has kept you stuck in the past. The
    1% Rule was designed to answer three core questions: Why do some people seem to
    achieve massive success with everything they do — while others can't seem to get
    out of their own way? What separates those who get excited and inspired for a
    season, a quarter or a few months — and those who are consistently on fire? ​
    What are the mindsets, principles, routines and behaviors of those who execute
    daily, and those who sit on the sidelines pondering? ...through answering these
    questions over the last decade in the trenches with thousands of people — they
    are now the framework of The 1% Rule and are yours today. It's time to take your
    power back, grab your copy now. If you're ready to ditch the highlight reel illusion...
    If you're tired of sitting on the sidlines waiting... If you're frustrated with
    the 24/7 noise... You've come to the right place!"

  title: Think and Grow Rich
  authors:
    - Napoleon Hill
  publishedDate: "2005-08-18"
  description:
    Think and Grow Rich has been called the "Granddaddy of All Motivational
    Literature." It was the first book to boldly ask, "What makes a winner?" The man
    who asked and listened for the answer, Napoleon Hill, is now counted in the top
    ranks of the world's winners himself. The most famous of all teachers of success
    spent "a fortune and the better part of a lifetime of effort" to produce the "Law
    of Success" philosophy that forms the basis of his books and that is so powerfully
    summarized in this one. In the original Think and Grow Rich, published in 1937,
    Hill draws on stories of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and other
    millionaires of his generation to illustrate his principles. In the updated version,
    Arthur R. Pell, Ph.D., a nationally known author, lecturer, and consultant in
    human resources management and an expert in applying Hill's thought, deftly interweaves
    anecdotes of how contemporary millionaires and billionaires, such as Bill Gates,
    Mary Kay Ash, Dave Thomas, and Sir John Templeton, achieved their wealth. Outmoded
    or arcane terminology and examples are faithfully refreshed to preclude any stumbling
    blocks to a new generation of readers.

  title: The Coaching Habit
  authors:

  description:
    Coaching is an essential skill for leaders. But for most busy, overworked
    managers, coaching employees is done badly, or not at all. They're just too busy,
    and it's too hard to change. But what if managers could coach their people in
    10 minutes or less? In Michael Bungay Stanier's The Coaching Habit, coaching becomes
    a regular, informal part of your day so managers and their teams can work less
    hard and have more impact. Coaching is an art and it's far easier said than done.
    It takes courage to ask a question rather than offer up advice, provide an answer,
    or unleash a solution. Giving another person the opportunity to find their own
    way, make their own mistakes, and create their own wisdom is both brave and vulnerable.
    It can also mean unlearning our ''fix it'' habits. In this practical and inspiring
    book, Michael shares seven transformative questions that can make a difference
    in how we lead and support. And, he guides us through the tricky part - how to
    take this new information and turn it into habits and a daily practice. -Brené
    Brown, author of Rising Strong and Daring Greatly Drawing on years of experience
    training more than 10,000 busy managers from around the globe in practical, everyday
    coaching skills, Bungay Stanier reveals how to unlock your peoples' potential.
    He unpacks seven essential coaching questions to demonstrate how---by saying less
    and asking more--you can develop coaching methods that produce great results.
    - Get straight to the point in any conversation with The Kickstart Question -
    Stay on track during any interaction with The AWE Question - Save hours of time
    for yourself with The Lazy Question, and hours of time for others with The Strategic
    Question - Get to the heart of any interpersonal or external challenge with The
    Focus Question and The Foundation Question - Finally, ensure others find your
    coaching as beneficial as you do with The Learning Question A fresh, innovative
    take on the traditional how-to manual, the book combines insider information with
    research based in neuroscience and behavioural economics, together with interactive
    training tools to turn practical advice into practiced habits. Dynamic question-and-answer
    sections help identify old habits and kick-start new behaviour, making sure you
    get the most out of all seven chapters. Witty and conversational, The Coaching
    Habit takes your work--and your workplace--from good to great.

  description:
    Japan is the most running-obsessed country on earth. A 135-mile relay
    race, or "ekiden," is the country's biggest annual sporting event. Thousands of
    professional runners compete for corporate teams in some of the most competitive
    races in the world. The legendary "marathon monks" run a thousand marathons in
    a thousand days to reach spiritual enlightenment.Yet so much of Japan's running
    culture remains a mystery to the outside world. Adharanand Finn, the award-winning
    author of Running with the Kenyans, spent six months immersed in this one-of-a-kind
    running culture to discover what it might teach us about the sport and about Japan.As
    an amateur runner about to turn 40, he also hoped to find out whether a Japanese
    approach to training might help him run faster. What he learns—about competition,
    team work, form, chasing personal bests, and about himself—will fascinate and
    surprise anyone keen to explore why we run and how we might do it better.

    The story of Ben Smith, who decided to run 401 marathons in 401 days.
    People thought he was mad, until they heard his story, then they began to understand.
    Having endured years of bullying as a child, Ben tried to take his own life. In
    adulthood, Ben struggled to feel content with the life that was mapped out for
    him. But having found his passion in running, Ben sold his possessions, escaped
    his old life and set off on what seemed like an impossible mission – The 401 Challenge.
    During his 10,506.2-mile odyssey criss-crossing the UK, Ben ran in 309 different
    locations, accompanied by more than 13,500 people. He visited 101 schools, burned
    an estimated 2.4 million calories, wrecked his back and braved every extreme of
    the British weather, while raising £330,000 for charity, touching the lives of
    millions. This is the inspiring journey of a previously lost and broken man who
    discovered that anything is possible, if only you choose to search for what makes
    you truly happy.

    "From the author of the bestseller Eat and Run, a thrilling memoir
    about his grueling, exhilarating, and immensely inspiring 46-day run to break
    the speed record for the Appalachian Trail. Scott Jurek is one of the world's
    best known and most beloved ultrarunners. Renowned for his remarkable endurance
    and speed, accomplished on a vegan diet, he's finished first in nearly all of
    ultrarunning's elite events over the course of his career. But after two decades
    of racing, training, speaking, and touring, Jurek felt an urgent need to discover
    something new about himself. He embarked on a wholly unique challenge, one that
    would force him to grow as a person and as an athlete: breaking the speed record
    for the Appalachian Trail. North is the story of the 2,189-mile journey that nearly
    shattered him. When he set out in the spring of 2015, Jurek anticipated punishing
    terrain, forbidding weather, and inevitable injuries. He would have to run nearly
    50 miles a day, every day, for almost seven weeks. He knew he would be pushing
    himself to the limit, that comfort and rest would be in short supply -- but he
    couldn't have imagined the physical and emotional toll the trip would exact, nor
    the rewards it would offer. With his wife, Jenny, friends, and the kindness of
    strangers supporting him, Jurek ran, hiked, and stumbled his way north, one white
    blaze at a time. A stunning narrative of perseverance and personal transformation,
    North is a portrait of a man stripped bare on the most demanding and transcendent
    effort of his life. It will inspire runners and non-runners alike to keep striving
    for their personal best."

    "'If you want to achieve more (without going nuts), read this book.'
    Charles Duhigg 'Essential reading for anyone who wants to create a happier, more
    successful life.' Gretchen Rubin Nobody ever looked at an empty calendar and said,
    'The best way to spend this time is by cramming it full of meetings!' Or got to
    work in the morning and thought, 'Today I'll spend hours on Facebook!' Yet, that's
    exactly what we do. Why? In a world where information refreshes endlessly and
    the workday feels like a race to react to other people's priorities faster, frazzled
    and distracted has become our default position. But what if the exhaustion of
    constant busyness wasn't mandatory? What if you could step off the hamster wheel
    and start taking control of your time and attention? That's what this book is
    about. As creators of Google Ventures' renowned 'design sprint', Jake and John
    have helped hundreds of teams solve important problems by changing how they work.
    Building on the success of these sprints and their experience designing ubiquitous
    tech products like Gmail and YouTube, they spent years experimenting with their
    own personal habits and routines, looking for ways to help individuals optimize
    their energy, focus, and time. Now they've packaged the most effective tactics
    into a four-step daily framework that anyone can use to systematically design
    their days. Make Time is not a one-size-fits-all formula. Instead, it offers a
    customizable menu of bite-sized tips and strategies that can be tailored to individual
    habits and lifestyles. It isn't about productivity, or checking off more to-dos.
    Nor does it propose unrealistic solutions like throwing out your smartphone or
    swearing off social media. Making time isn't about radically overhauling your
    lifestyle; it's about making small shifts in your environment to liberate yourself
    from constant busyness and distraction. A must-read for anyone who has ever thought
    'If only there were more hours in the day...' Make Time will help you to stop
    passively reacting to the demands of the modern world and start intentionally
    making time for the things that matter."

  description:
    This New York Times–bestselling book upends conventional thinking about
    autism and suggests a broader model for acceptance, understanding, and full participation
    in society for people who think differently. What is autism? A lifelong disability,
    or a naturally occurring form of cognitive difference akin to certain forms of
    genius? In truth, it is all of these things and more—and the future of our society
    depends on our understanding it. Wired reporter Steve Silberman unearths the secret
    history of autism, long suppressed by the same clinicians who became famous for
    discovering it, and finds surprising answers to the crucial question of why the
    number of diagnoses has soared in recent years. Going back to the earliest days
    of autism research, Silberman offers a gripping narrative of Leo Kanner and Hans
    Asperger, the research pioneers who defined the scope of autism in profoundly
    different ways; he then goes on to explore the game-changing concept of neurodiversity.
    NeuroTribes considers the idea that neurological differences such as autism, dyslexia,
    and ADHD are not errors of nature or products of the toxic modern world, but the
    result of natural variations in the human genome. This groundbreaking book will
    reshape our understanding of the history, meaning, function, and implications
    of neurodiversity in our world.

  description:
    “Marie Kondo, but for your brain.” —HelloGiggles “Compelling from front
    to back. Highly recommend.” —Marc Andreessen Reading this book could change your
    life. The Courage to Be Disliked, already an enormous bestseller in Asia with
    more than 3.5 million copies sold, demonstrates how to unlock the power within
    yourself to be the person you truly want to be. Is happiness something you choose
    for yourself? The Courage to Be Disliked presents a simple and straightforward
    answer. Using the theories of Alfred Adler, one of the three giants of nineteenth-century
    psychology alongside Freud and Jung, this book follows an illuminating dialogue
    between a philosopher and a young man. Over the course of five conversations,
    the philosopher helps his student to understand how each of us is able to determine
    the direction of our own life, free from the shackles of past traumas and the
    expectations of others. Rich in wisdom, The Courage to Be Disliked will guide
    you through the concepts of self-forgiveness, self-care, and mind decluttering.
    It is a deeply liberating way of thinking, allowing you to develop the courage
    to change and ignore the limitations that you might be placing on yourself. This
    plainspoken and profoundly moving book unlocks the power within you to find lasting
    happiness and be the person you truly want to be. Millions have already benefited
    from its teachings, now you can too.

  description:
    An electrifying look inside the wild world of extreme distance running.
    Once the reserve of only the most hardcore enthusiasts, ultra running is now a
    thriving global industry, with hundreds of thousands of competitors each year.
    But is the rise of this most brutal and challenging sport—with races that extend
    into hundreds of miles, often in extreme environments—an antidote to modern life,
    or a symptom of a modern illness? In The Rise of the Ultra Runners, award-winning
    author Adharanand Finn travels to the heart of the sport to investigate the reasons
    behind its rise and discover what it takes to join the ranks of these ultra athletes.
    Through encounters with the extreme and colorful characters of the ultramarathon
    world, and his own experiences of running ultras everywhere from the deserts of
    Oman to the Rocky Mountains, Finn offers a fascinating account of people testing
    the boundaries of human endeavor.

  title: The Lean Startup
  authors:
    - Eric Ries
  publishedDate: "2011"
  description:
    Most startups are built to fail. But those failures, according to entrepreneur
    Eric Ries, are preventable. Startups don't fail because of bad execution, or missed
    deadlines, or blown budgets. They fail because they are building something nobody
    wants. Whether they arise from someone's garage or are created within a mature
    Fortune 500 organization, new ventures, by definition, are designed to create
    new products or services under conditions of extreme uncertainly. Their primary
    mission is to find out what customers ultimately will buy. One of the central
    premises of The Lean Startup movement is what Ries calls "validated learning"
    about the customer. It is a way of getting continuous feedback from customers
    so that the company can shift directions or alter its plans inch by inch, minute
    by minute. Rather than creating an elaborate business plan and a product-centric
    approach, Lean Startup prizes testing your vision continuously with your customers
    and making constant adjustments…

  title: Why Running Matters
  authors:
    - Ian Mortimer
  publishedDate: "2019-03-14"
  description:
    You might run for fitness. You might run for speed. But ultimately,
    running is about much more than the physical act itself. It is about the challenges
    we face in life, and how we measure up to them. It is about companionship, endurance,
    ambition, hope, conviction, determination, self-respect and inspiration. It is
    about how we choose to live our lives, and what it means to share our values with
    other people. In this year-long memoir, which might be described as a historian's
    take on Haruki Murakami's What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, the celebrated
    historian Ian Mortimer considers the meaning of running as he approaches his fiftieth
    birthday. From injuries and frustrated ambitions to exhilaration and empathy,
    it is a personal and yet universal account of what running means to people, and
    how it helps everyone focus on what really matters.

    "IMPROV IS NOT ABOUT BEING FUNNY, ORIGINAL, OR CHAOTIC. IT'S ABOUT
    EMBRACING CHANGE. Improvisation. The mere mention of the word makes many people
    quake with fear at the prospect of chaos and uncertainty. The fact is, though,
    human beings are improvising almost every minute of their lives it is more natural,
    and more filled with possibility, than you might imagine. On stage, improvisational
    actors use simple rules, collaborative principles, and game constraints to build
    unscripted yet intriguing storylines. This book explores how those same simple
    rules and principles can help agile teams collaborate more effectively and how
    purposefully working within constraints can unlock creativity. Inside, you ll
    find over 50 techniques and improv games tailored for agile teams, complete with
    step-by-step instructions. These games are based on five different principles
    of improvisational theatre: SAFETY how accepting failure is essential to discovery
    SPONTANEITY how to increase the flow of ideas STORYTELLING how narratives help
    teams relate to their customers and end users STATUS how adjusting personal behaviour
    can encourage collaboration SENSITIVITY how to become more fully engaged with
    fellow team members"

  description:
    "A Scrum Master's work is never done. The Development team needs your
    support, the Product Owner is often lost in the complexities of agile product
    management, and your managers and stakeholders need to know what will be done,
    by when, and for how much. Learn how experienced Scrum Masters balance the demands
    of these three levels of servant leadership while removing organizational impediments
    and helping Scrum Teams deliver real world value. Discover how to visualize your
    work, resolve impediments, and empower your teams to self-organize and deliver
    using the Scrum Values, Agile Principles, and advanced coaching and facilitation
    techniques. A Scrum Master needs to know when their team is in trouble and understand
    how to help them get back on the path to delivery. Become a better Scrum master
    so you can find the problems holding your teams back. Has your Daily Scrum turned
    in to a meeting? Does your team struggle with creating user stories? Are stakeholders
    disengaged during Sprint Review? These issues are common. Learn to use empiricism
    as your guide and help your teams create great products. Scrum is so much more
    than a checklist of practices to follow, yet that's exactly how many organizations
    practice it. Bring life back to your Scrum events by using advanced facilitation
    techniques to leverage the full intelligence of your team. Improve your retrospectives
    with new formats and exercises. Ask powerful questions that spark introspection
    and improvement. Get support and buy-in from management. Use Scrum as a competitive
    advantage for your organization. Create a definition of done that improves quality
    and fix failing sprints. Take the next step on your journey as a Scrum master.
    Transform your Scrum practices to help your teams enjoy their work again as they
    deliver high quality products that bring value to the world. What You Need: A
    moderate level of experience using the Scrum Framework."

    "Los Angeles Times bestseller • More than 1.5 million copies sold “Workers
    looking for more fulfilling positions should start by identifying their ikigai.”
    ―Business Insider “One of the unintended—yet positive—consequences of the [pandemic]
    is that it is forcing people to reevaluate their jobs, careers, and lives. Use
    this time wisely, find your personal ikigai, and live your best life.” ―Forbes
    *And from the same authors, don’t miss The Book of Ichigo Ichie—about making the
    most of every moment in your life.* * * * Find your ikigai (pronounced ee-key-guy)
    and bring meaning and joy to all your days. “Only staying active will make you
    want to live a hundred years.” —Japanese proverb According to the Japanese, everyone
    has an ikigai—a reason for living. And according to the residents of the Japanese
    village with the world’s longest-living people, finding it is the key to a happier
    and longer life. Having a strong sense of ikigai—where what you love, what you’re
    good at, what you can get paid for, and what the world needs all overlap—means
    that each day is infused with meaning. It’s the reason we get up in the morning.
    It’s also the reason many Japanese never really retire (in fact there’s no word
    in Japanese that means retire in the sense it does in English): They remain active
    and work at what they enjoy, because they’ve found a real purpose in life—the
    happiness of always being busy. In researching this book, the authors interviewed
    the residents of the Japanese village with the highest percentage of 100-year-olds—one
    of the world’s Blue Zones. Ikigai reveals the secrets to their longevity and happiness:
    how they eat, how they move, how they work, how they foster collaboration and
    community, and—their best-kept secret—how they find the ikigai that brings satisfaction
    to their lives. And it provides practical tools to help you discover your own
    ikigai. Because who doesn’t want to find happiness in every day? A PENGUIN LIFE

    This open access Pivot demonstrates how a variety of technologies act
    as innovation catalysts within the banking and financial services sector. Traditional
    banks and financial services are under increasing competition from global IT companies
    such as Google, Apple, Amazon and PayPal whilst facing pressure from investors
    to reduce costs, increase agility and improve customer retention. Technologies
    such as blockchain, cloud computing, mobile technologies, big data analytics and
    social media therefore have perhaps more potential in this industry and area of
    business than any other. This book defines a fintech ecosystem for the 21st century,
    providing a state-of-the art review of current literature, suggesting avenues
    for new research and offering perspectives from business, technology and industry.

    "This comprehensive guide serves to illuminate the rise and development
    of FinTech in Sweden, with the Internet as the key underlying driver. The multiple
    case studies examine topics such as: the adoption of online banking in Sweden;
    the identification and classification of different FinTech categories; process
    innovation developments within the traditional banking industry; and the Venture
    Capital (VC) landscape in Sweden, as shown through interviews with VC representatives,
    mainly from Sweden but also from the US and Germany, as well as offering insight
    into the companies that are currently operating in the FinTech arena in Sweden.
    The authors address questions such as: How will the regulatory landscape shape
    the future of FinTech companies? What are the factors that will likely drive the
    adoption of FinTech services in the future? What is the future role of banks in
    the context of FinTech and digitalization? What are the policies and government
    initiatives that aim to support the FinTech ecosystem in Sweden? Complex concepts
    and ideas are rendered in an easily digestible yet thought-provoking way. The

  description:
    This book provides digital leaders who are accountable for the rapid
    development of high-quality software applications a concise guide to designing,
    implementing, measuring, and improving DevOps programs that are tailored to their
    organizations.In DevOps for Digital Leaders, deep collective experience on both
    sides of the dev–ops divide informs the global thought leadership and penetrating
    insights of the authors, all three of whom are cross-portfolio DevOps leaders
    at CA Technologies. Aruna Ravichandran, Kieran Taylor, and Peter Waterhouse analyze
    the organizational benefits, costs, freedoms, and constraints of DevOps. They
    chart the coordinated strategy of organizational change, metrics, lean thinking,
    and investment that an enterprise must undertake to realize the full potential
    of DevOps and reach the sweet spot where accelerating code deployments drive increasing
    customer satisfaction, revenue, and profitability. Digital leaders are charged
    to bridge the dev–ops disconnect if their organizations are to survive and flourish
    in a business world increasingly differentiated by the degree to which dynamic
    application software development harmonizes with operational resilience and reliability.
    This short book applies the DevOps perspective to the competitive challenge, faced
    by every high-performance IT organization today, of integrating and automating
    open source, cloud, and enterprise tools, processes, and techniques across the
    software development life cycle from requirements to release. What Readers Will
    Learn • Remove dependencies and constraints so that parallel practices can accelerate
    the development of defect-free software • Automate continuous delivery across
    the software life cycle to eliminate release bottlenecks, manual labor waste,
    and technical debt accumulation • Generate virtualized production-style testing
    of applications through real-time behavioral analytics • Adopt agile practices
    so operations teams can support developer productivity with automated feedback,

  description:
    What if you could combine the agility, adaptability, and cohesion of
    a small team with the power and resources of a giant organization? When General
    Stanley McChrystal took command of the Joint Special Operations Task Force in
    Iraq in 2003, he quickly realized that conventional military tactics were failing.
    The allied forces had a huge advantage in numbers, equipment and training - but
    none of the enemy's speed and flexibility. McChrystal and his colleagues discarded
    a century of conventional wisdom to create a 'team of teams' that combined extremely
    transparent communication with decentralized decision-making authority. Faster,
    flatter and more flexible, the task force beat back al-Qaeda. In this powerful
    book, McChrystal and his colleagues show how the challenges they faced in Iraq
    can be relevant to any leader. Through compelling examples, the authors demonstrate
    that the 'team of teams' strategy has worked everywhere from hospital emergency
    rooms to NASA and has the potential to transform organizations large and small.
    'An indispensable guide to organizational change.' Walter Isaacson, author of

    sum of their parts.' Charles Duhigg, author of The Power of Habit

  description:
    This book was written by a software engineer for software engineers.
    It provides an overview of various communication skills and techniques that are
    relevant to people working in the software industry. Some of the communications
    skills discussed in this book have a generic nature, such as self-awareness. Others
    are more specific for engineers, such as writing clean code. The result is a comprehensive
    coverage of communication as it concerns software engineers with many practical
    and relevant tips to follow. The book sometimes focuses on communication between
    engineers and at other times, it explores how to interact with others, typically
    in a business context. When we say "engineers" in this book, we generalize and
    refer to software engineers, programmers, developers, designers, engineering managers,
    PMs, software architects, or anyone else working in software development.In this
    book, each communication skill will be discussed with specific tips to improve
    yourself in a well-structured, constructive, and productive fashion. The end goal
    is to increase your impact as an engineer by focusing on "soft skills" that complement
    your existing coding and problem solving skills.

  description:
    A revised and updated edition of the acclaimed Wall Street Journal
    bestseller that explores why some leaders drain capability and intelligence from
    their teams while others amplify it to produce better results. We’ve all had experience
    with two dramatically different types of leaders. The first type drains intelligence,
    energy, and capability from the people around them and always needs to be the
    smartest person in the room. These are the idea killers, the energy sappers, the
    diminishers of talent and commitment. On the other side of the spectrum are leaders
    who use their intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities of the people
    around them. When these leaders walk into a room, light bulbs go off over people’s
    heads; ideas flow and problems get solved. These are the leaders who inspire employees
    to stretch themselves to deliver results that surpass expectations. These are
    the Multipliers. And the world needs more of them, especially now when leaders
    are expected to do more with less. In this engaging and highly practical book,
    leadership expert Liz Wiseman explores these two leadership styles, persuasively
    showing how Multipliers can have a resoundingly positive and profitable effect
    on organizations—getting more done with fewer resources, developing and attracting
    talent, and cultivating new ideas and energy to drive organizational change and
    innovation. In analyzing data from more than 150 leaders, Wiseman has identified
    five disciplines that distinguish Multipliers from Diminishers. These five disciplines
    are not based on innate talent; indeed, they are skills and practices that everyone
    can learn to use—even lifelong and recalcitrant Diminishers. Lively, real-world
    case studies and practical tips and techniques bring to life each of these principles,
    showing you how to become a Multiplier too, whether you are a new or an experienced
    manager. This revered classic has been updated with new examples of Multipliers,
    as well as two new chapters one on accidental Diminishers, and one on how to deal
    with Diminishers. Just imagine what you could accomplish if you could harness
    all the energy and intelligence around you. Multipliers will show you how.

  description:
    Over the past 30 years, the world has seen great social improvements.
    Technology has been developing at an enormous pace and is helping to solve our
    most pressing social and environmental challenges. Yet, despite this success,
    our current model of development is still deeply problematic. Natural disasters
    triggered by climate change have doubled since the 1980s, violence and armed conflict
    now cost more than 13 percent of GDP, social inequality and youth unemployment
    is worsening around the world, and climate change threatens the global population
    with tremendous environmental as well as social problems. Using the United Nations
    Sustainable Development Goals as a framework, this book sets out how business
    and capital now have a real opportunity to help resolve these problems. With clear
    and plentiful examples and cases of how businesses are making a difference, relevant
    facts and figures to support the cases, and inspiring and instructional information
    on how businesses can create sustainable value, this highly readable book is a
    must-read for businesses (large and small) that wish to genuinely support the
    delivery of the SDGs. The Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs) drive change and offer a narrative and an opportunity to all to speak
    in one language on sustainability. They provide us with a clear set of targets
    for 2030. Through following the SDGs, opportunities abound for business and capital
    to unlock markets which offer endless potential for profit while at the same time
    working towards the Sustainable Development Goals. This book illustrates for business
    how to make the much-needed Trillion Dollar Shift.

    TOP 5 BEST BUSINESS BOOKS OF THE YEAR 2020 - The Times "If there was
    ever a business book suitable for TV adaptation, this is it." - FT "A banking
    blockbuster" - The Observer Magazine "Sent shockwaves through the tight-knit world
    of UK tech and venture capital" - Yahoo Finance BANKING ON IT is the first-hand
    account of one woman's quest to rebuild Britain's broken banking system. After
    a lengthy career at the top of some of Britain's leading banks Anne Boden had
    become disillusioned with the status quo - the financial crash had broken trust
    in the whole sector but there seemed to be little appetite to make the most of
    emerging technologies to revolutionise customer experience. Increasingly frustrated
    with the inertia within the industry she decided to shake things up herself by
    doing something totally radical - setting up her own bank. In this awe-inspiring
    story Anne reveals how she broke through bureaucracy, tackled prejudice and successfully
    countered widespread suspicion to realise her vision for the future of consumer
    banking. She fulfilled that dream by founding Starling, the winner of Best British
    Bank at the British Bank Awards in 2018, 2019 and 2020, and in doing so has triggered
    a new movement that is revolutionising the entire banking industry.

  description:
    Read hilarious stories with serious lessons that Michael Lopp extracts
    from his varied and sometimes bizarre experiences as a manager at Apple, Pinterest,
    Palantir, Netscape, Symantec, Slack, and Borland. Many of the stories first appeared
    in primitive form in Lopp’s perennially popular blog, Rands in Repose. The Third
    Edition of Managing Humans contains a whole new season of episodes from the ongoing
    saga of Lopp's adventures in Silicon Valley, together with classic episodes remastered
    for high fidelity and freshness. Whether you're an aspiring manager, a current
    manager, or just wondering what the heck a manager does all day, there is a story
    in this book that will speak to you—and help you survive and prosper amid the
    general craziness of dysfunctional bright people caught up in the chase of riches
    and power. Scattered in repose among these manic misfits are managers, an even
    stranger breed of people who, through a mystical organizational ritual, have been
    given power over the futures and the bank accounts of many others. Lopp's straight-from-the-hip
    style is unlike that of any other writer on management and leadership. He pulls
    no punches and tells stories he probably shouldn't. But they are magically instructive
    and yield Lopp’s trenchant insights on leadership that cut to the heart of the
    matter—whether it's dealing with your boss, handling a slacker, hiring top guns,
    or seeing a knotty project through to completion. Writing code is easy. Managing
    humans is not. You need a book to help you do it, and this is it. What You'll
    Learn How teams work How to lead engineers How to handle conflict How to hire
    well How to motivate employees How to manage your boss How to say no How to understand
    different engineering personalities How to build effective teams “/li> How to
    handle stressed people freaking out How to run a meeting well How to scale teams
    Who This Book Is For This book is designed for managers and would-be managers
    staring at the role of a manager wondering why they would ever leave the safe
    world of bits and bytes for the messy world of managing humans. The book covers
    handling conflict, managing wildly differing personality types, infusing innovation
    into insane product schedules, and figuring out how to build a lasting and useful
    engineering culture.

  title: Narrative Economics
  authors:
    - Robert J. Shiller
  publishedDate: 2020-09
  description:
    From Nobel Prize–winning economist and New York Times bestselling author
    Robert Shiller, a groundbreaking account of how stories help drive economic events—and
    why financial panics can spread like epidemic viruses Stories people tell—about
    financial confidence or panic, housing booms, or Bitcoin—can go viral and powerfully
    affect economies, but such narratives have traditionally been ignored in economics
    and finance because they seem anecdotal and unscientific. In this groundbreaking
    book, Robert Shiller explains why we ignore these stories at our peril—and how
    we can begin to take them seriously. Using a rich array of examples and data,
    Shiller argues that studying popular stories that influence individual and collective
    economic behavior—what he calls "narrative economics"—may vastly improve our ability
    to predict, prepare for, and lessen the damage of financial crises and other major
    economic events. The result is nothing less than a new way to think about the
    economy, economic change, and economics. In a new preface, Shiller reflects on

  description:
    "This book offers readers a startling view of how blockchain technology
    will transform the financial industry in profound ways. Some of the world's top
    thinkers in blockchain have contributed chapters that survey the coming digital
    storm - how it will level the playing field, give individuals more financial power,
    and create greater transparency in operations. Written for the educated financial
    reader, it reveals how blockchain can create a token-based incentive system that
    aligns the interests of participants in large-scale initiatives, as well as the
    rewiring of global payment networks and innovative financing methods such as initial
    coin offerings to fund infrastructure development. The transition for the financial
    industry is bound to be complicated, but it presents enormous opportunity for
    those who understand the storm as it's brewing. \"In Financial Services Revolution,
    Alex Tapscott opens a window into a dynamic future, featuring the early stages
    of a transition to a natively digital global economy, sporting various degrees
    of decentralization. It will be a complicated transition for financial, economic,
    social, and political systems, but I see it as one pregnant with hope and promise.\"\
    \ - Joseph Lubin, CEO, ConsenSys \"Nobody has a better handle on the coming digital
    storm and its broad implications than Alex Tapscott. In Financial Services Revolution,
    Alex lays out the blueprint for how to survive and then thrive in this era of
    digital disruption.\" - Harris Fricker, President and CEO, GMP Securities LP \"\
    Alex Tapscott is one of the blockchain industry's foremost leaders and earliest
    believers. His work as an investor, advocate, educator, and business builder has
    contributed immense value to the development of the digital asset market.\" -
    Cole Diamond, Chairman and CEO, Coinsquare \"This book will help successful financial
    services leaders with a pressing need: to relentlessly push the boundaries of
    their tech knowledge, with imagination around its application.\" - Dean Connor,
    President and CEO, Sun Life Financial \"Blockchain has the potential to transform
    financial services in profound ways, to level playing fields, favour collaboration
    over competition, and enable the individual to enjoy as much agency as the corporation
    does today in financial matters. This book explains how. A must-read.\" - Joseph
    Lubin, CEO, ConsenSys \"This book shows how blockchain is a game changer for data
    and transfer of value -at the heart of financial and government services today.
    \" - Linda Mantia, former Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating
    Officer, Manulife Financial \"It was an honour to contribute to the Blockchain
    Research Institute's comprehensive investigation into blockchain's promise and
    the challenges that come with it. This is a must-read volume for anyone interested
    in this potentially transformative technology.\" - Michael Casey, Chief Content
    Officer, CoinDesk \"Thoroughly researched and brimming with new insights, Financial
    Services Revolutionis required reading for every Wall Street banker and all who
    care about the future of money and finance.\" - Bill Barhydt, CEO and Founder,

    to the global conversation on the future of finance. This book extends that dialogue.
    It looks at how financial services might approach a technological revolution originally

    "From Kim Scott, author of the revolutionary New York Times bestseller
    Radical Candor, comes Just Work: Get Sh*t Done, Fast & Fair—how we can recognize,
    attack, and eliminate workplace injustice—and transform our careers and organizations
    in the process. We—all of us—consistently exclude, underestimate, and underutilize
    huge numbers of people in the workforce even as we include, overestimate, and
    promote others, often beyond their level of competence. Not only is this immoral
    and unjust, it's bad for business. Just Work is the solution. Just Work is Kim
    Scott's new book, revealing a practical framework for both respecting everyone’s
    individuality and collaborating effectively. This is the essential guide leaders
    and their employees need to create more just workplaces and establish new norms
    of collaboration and respect."

    "You're Not Listening is New York Times contributor Kate Murphy's eye-opening
    wake-up call about the worldwide epidemic of not listening. \"If you’re like most
    people, you don’t listen as often or as well as you’d like. There’s no one better
    qualified than a talented journalist to introduce you to the right mindset and
    skillset—and this book does it with science and humor.\"—Adam Grant, #1 New York
    Times bestselling author of Originals and Give and Take **Hand picked by Malcolm
    Gladwell, Adam Grant, Susan Cain, and Daniel Pink for Next Big Ideas Club** \"\
    An essential book for our times.\"—Lori Gottlieb, New York Times bestselling author
    of Maybe You Should Talk to Someone When was the last time you listened to someone,
    or someone really listened to you? At work, we’re taught to lead the conversation.
    On social media, we shape our personal narratives. At parties, we talk over one
    another. So do our politicians. We’re not listening. And no one is listening to
    us. Despite living in a world where technology allows constant digital communication
    and opportunities to connect, it seems no one is really listening or even knows
    how. And it’s making us lonelier, more isolated, and less tolerant than ever before.
    A listener by trade, New York Times contributor Kate Murphy wanted to know how
    we got here. In this always illuminating and often humorous deep dive, Murphy
    explains why we’re not listening, what it’s doing to us, and how we can reverse
    the trend. She makes accessible the psychology, neuroscience, and sociology of
    listening while also introducing us to some of the best listeners out there (including
    a CIA agent, focus group moderator, bartender, radio producer, and top furniture
    salesman). Equal parts cultural observation, scientific exploration, and rousing
    call to action that's full of practical advice, You're Not Listening is to listening
    what Susan Cain's Quiet was to introversion. It’s time to stop talking and start
    listening."

    The definitive account of the Scrum methodology from its co-creator
    and the CEO of Scrum, Inc., Jeff Sutherland. Scrum is the revolutionary approach
    to project management and team building that has helped to transform everything
    from software companies to the US military to healthcare in major American hospitals.
    In this major new book its originator, Jeff Sutherland, explains precisely and
    step by step how it operates âe" and how it can be made to work for anyone, anywhere.
    Take the FBI attempt to digitize its records, for example. As with so many software
    projects the first attempt failed, having taken four years and cost over $400
    million.Then the FBI turned to Scrum, and just over a year later unveiled a functioning
    system that cost less than a tenth of the first project and employed a tenth of
    the staff. And it's not just grand projects that Scrum can help with. Every organisation,
    whatever its size, constantly has to come to grips with delivering a product or
    service on time and on budget. Scrum shows you how. It explains how to define
    precisely what it is that you are seeking to achieve, how to set up the team to
    achieve it, and how to monitor progress until the project is successfully completed.
    Filled with practical examples drawn from all types and organisation it will make
    you rethink the fundamentals of successful management âe" and show you how to
    get things done however everyday or ambitious, however small or large your organisation.

    '[Thich Nhat Hanh] shows us the connection between personal, inner
    peace and peace on earth." –His Holiness The Dalai Lama Nominated by Martin Luther
    King, Jr. for a Nobel Peace Prize, Thich Nhat Hanh is one of today’s leading sources
    of wisdom, peace, compassion and comfort. It was under the bodhi tree in India
    twenty-five centuries ago that Buddha achieved the insight that three states of
    mind were the source of all our unhappiness: wrong knowing, obsessive desire,
    and anger. All are difficult, but in one instant of anger—one of the most powerful
    emotions—lives can be ruined, and health and spiritual development can be destroyed.
    With exquisite simplicity, Buddhist monk and Vietnam refugee Thich Nhat Hanh gives
    tools and advice for transforming relationships, focusing energy, and rejuvenating
    those parts of ourselves that have been laid waste by anger. His extraordinary
    wisdom can transform your life and the lives of the people you love, and in the
    words of Thich Nhat Hanh, can give each reader the power "to change everything.'

  description:
    "A former international hostage negotiator for the FBI offers a new,
    field-tested approach to high-stakes negotiations—whether in the boardroom or
    at home. After a stint policing the rough streets of Kansas City, Missouri, Chris
    Voss joined the FBI, where his career as a hostage negotiator brought him face-to-face
    with a range of criminals, including bank robbers and terrorists. Reaching the
    pinnacle of his profession, he became the FBI’s lead international kidnapping
    negotiator. Never Split the Difference takes you inside the world of high-stakes
    negotiations and into Voss’s head, revealing the skills that helped him and his
    colleagues succeed where it mattered most: saving lives. In this practical guide,
    he shares the nine effective principles—counterintuitive tactics and strategies—you
    too can use to become more persuasive in both your professional and personal life.
    Life is a series of negotiations you should be prepared for: buying a car, negotiating
    a salary, buying a home, renegotiating rent, deliberating with your partner. Taking
    emotional intelligence and intuition to the next level, Never Split the Difference
    gives you the competitive edge in any discussion."

  description:
    'Wall Street Journal bestseller! Poker champion turned business consultant
    Annie Duke teaches you how to get comfortable with uncertainty and make better
    decisions as a result. In Super Bowl XLIX, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll made one
    of the most controversial calls in football history: With 26 seconds remaining,
    and trailing by four at the Patriots'' one-yard line, he called for a pass instead
    of a hand off to his star running back. The pass was intercepted and the Seahawks
    lost. Critics called it the dumbest play in history. But was the call really that
    bad? Or did Carroll actually make a great move that was ruined by bad luck? Even
    the best decision doesn''t yield the best outcome every time. There''s always an
    element of luck that you can''t control, and there is always information that is
    hidden from view. So the key to long-term success (and avoiding worrying yourself
    to death) is to think in bets: How sure am I? What are the possible ways things
    could turn out? What decision has the highest odds of success? Did I land in the
    unlucky 10% on the strategy that works 90% of the time? Or is my success attributable
    to dumb luck rather than great decision making? Annie Duke, a former World Series
    of Poker champion turned business consultant, draws on examples from business,
    sports, politics, and (of course) poker to share tools anyone can use to embrace
    uncertainty and make better decisions. For most people, it''s difficult to say
    "I''m not sure" in a world that values and, even, rewards the appearance of certainty.
    But professional poker players are comfortable with the fact that great decisions
    don''t always lead to great outcomes and bad decisions don''t always lead to bad
    outcomes. By shifting your thinking from a need for certainty to a goal of accurately
    assessing what you know and what you don''t, you''ll be less vulnerable to reactive
    emotions, knee-jerk biases, and destructive habits in your decision making. You''ll
    become more confident, calm, compassionate and successful in the long run.'

    Increase profitability, elevate work culture, and exceed productivity
    goals with this updated and expanded edition of the definitive handbook for DevOps.More
    than ever, the effective management of technology is critical for business competitiveness.
    For decades, technology leaders have struggled to balance agility, reliability,
    and security. The consequences of failure have never been greater―whether it's
    the healthcare.gov debacle, cardholder data breaches, or missing the boat with
    Big Data in the cloud.And yet, high performers using DevOps principles, such as
    Google, Amazon, Facebook, Etsy, and Netflix, are routinely and reliably deploying
    code into production hundreds, or even thousands, of times per day.Following in
    the footsteps of The Phoenix Project, The DevOps Handbook shows leaders how to
    replicate these incredible outcomes, by showing how to integrate Product Management,
    Development, QA, IT Operations, and Information Security to elevate your company
    and win in the marketplace.

    "We unlock our greatness by working on the hard things. Coaching expert
    and bestselling author Michael Bungay Stanier (MBS) is on a mission: to help people
    achieve their most ambitious, daunting, worthy projects. But how can you get across
    the threshold so you can make bolder, more courageous choices in other areas of
    your life? The secret doesn’t lie in mastering new habits and hacks; it’s about
    downloading a new operating system for your life. MBS shows you how to regain
    power and make forward progression on projects and dreams that are meaningful
    to you. First, figure out The Plan. Be unabashedly ambitious for yourself and
    the world, commit to the work of hard change, and begin your hero’s journey. Then,
    follow The Threshold Process. Set a worthy goal, weigh the prizes and punishments
    of acting (or not acting), and then take the first steps toward that goal. Instead
    of doubting yourself, fearing you’ll make a mistake, and feeling like you need
    to play “small” so you don’t disrupt the status quo, start showing up for yourself
    so you can show up for the world. Don’t regret a life half-lived. Stepping up
    and pursuing your dreams is hard ... and it’s exhilarating, and it’s important.
    Let MBS show you how to get clear, get confident, and start anything that matters."

    "Learn to integrate programming with good documentation. This book
    teaches you the craft of documentation for each step in the software development
    lifecycle, from understanding your users’ needs to publishing, measuring, and
    maintaining useful developer documentation. Well-documented projects save time
    for both developers on the project and users of the software. Projects without
    adequate documentation suffer from poor developer productivity, project scalability,
    user adoption, and accessibility. In short: bad documentation kills projects.
    Docs for Developers demystifies the process of creating great developer documentation,
    following a team of software developers as they work to launch a new product.
    At each step along the way, you learn through examples, templates, and principles
    how to create, measure, and maintain documentation—tools you can adapt to the
    needs of your own organization. What You'll Learn Create friction logs and perform
    user research to understand your users’ frustrations Research, draft, and write
    different kinds of documentation, including READMEs, API documentation, tutorials,
    conceptual content, and release notes Publish and maintain documentation alongside
    regular code releases Measure the success of the content you create through analytics
    and user feedback Organize larger sets of documentation to help users find the
    right information at the right time Who This Book Is For Ideal for software developers
    who need to create documentation alongside code, or for technical writers, developer
    advocates, product managers, and other technical roles that create and contribute

    and high-performing culture at Netflix, where she was chief talent officer. In
    her new book, Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility, she
    shares what she learned there and elsewhere in Silicon Valley. McCord advocates
    practicing radical honesty in the workplace, saying good-bye to employees who
    don't fit the company's emerging needs, and motivating with challenging work,
    not promises, perks, and bonus plans. McCord argues that the old standbys of corporate
    HR--annual performance reviews, retention plans, employee empowerment and engagement
    programs--often end up being a colossal waste of time and resources. Her road-tested
    advice, offered with humor and irreverence, provides readers a different path

    'A fascinating exploration of how computer algorithms can be applied
    to our everyday lives, helping to solve common decision-making problems and illuminate
    the workings of the human mind All our lives are constrained by limited space
    and time, limits that give rise to a particular set of problems. What should we
    do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept?
    What balance of new activities and familiar favourites is the most fulfilling?
    These may seem like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not: computers, too,
    face the same constraints, so computer scientists have been grappling with their
    version of such problems for decades. And the solutions they''ve found have much
    to teach us. In a dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author Brian Christian
    (who holds degrees in computer science, philosophy, and poetry, and works at the
    intersection of all three) and Tom Griffiths (a UC Berkeley professor of cognitive
    science and psychology) show how the simple, precise algorithms used by computers
    can also untangle very human questions. They explain how to have better hunches
    and when to leave things to chance, how to deal with overwhelming choices and
    how best to connect with others. From finding a spouse to finding a parking spot,
    from organizing one''s inbox to understanding the workings of human memory, Algorithms
    to Live By transforms the wisdom of computer science into strategies for human
    living."'

    The hilarious trials and tribulations of stand-up comedian Paul Tonkinson
    as he attempts to beat the much lauded 3-hour mark at the London Marathon. Paul
    Tonkinson is the well-known stand-up who has been presenting radio shows and appearing
    on television regularly for almost thirty years. 26.2 Miles to Happiness charts
    his quest to beat the much lauded 3-hour mark at the London Marathon. But this
    is not simply a story about beating The Wall. This is a story to show runners
    and non-runners alike how one of life's simple pleasures really can make everything
    better. Along the way, we are introduced to the characters helping Paul with his
    quest. There is wit and wisdom from celebrity names such as Bryony Gordon, Russell
    Howard, Roisin Conaty and Vassos Alexander. There's even an alpine adventure to
    the Mayr Clinic with Michael McIntyre that pushes Paul to the limit. And not forgetting
    the "words of wisdom" from Paul's anti-running friend, Richard. Ultimately, Paul
    is one of us. He is our consoling friend. The everyman who goes through extreme
    pain and battles with his own personal demons, but comes out the other side smiling.
    And this book will show you why.

  title: The Five Dysfunctions Of A Team
  authors:
    - Patrick Lencioni
  publishedDate: "2002"
  description:
    "In \"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team\" Patrick Lencioni once again
    offers a leadership fable that is as enthralling and instructive as his first
    two best-selling books, \"The Five Temptations of a CEO\" and \"The Four Obsessions
    of an Extraordinary Executive,\" This time, he turns his keen intellect and storytelling
    power to the fascinating, complex world of teams. Kathryn Petersen, Decision Tech's
    CEO, faces the ultimate leadership crisis: Uniting a team in such disarray that
    it threatens to bring down the entire company. Will she succeed? Will she be fired?
    Will the company fail? Lencioni's utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder
    that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight. Throughout the story,
    Lencioni reveals the five dysfunctions which go to the very heart of why teams
    even the best ones-often struggle. He outlines a powerful model and actionable
    steps that can be used to overcome these common hurdles and build a cohesive,
    effective team. Just as with his other books, Lencioni has written a compelling
    fable with a powerful yet deceptively simple message for all those who strive
    to be exceptional team leaders. -----------------------------------------------
    Praise for Patrick Lencioni \"A gripping analysis of what makes teams work effectively.
    This fine work is a must-read for any leader that has come to grips with the fact
    that no one makes progress-much less succeeds-alone.\" --James H. Amos Jr., president
    and CEO, Mail Boxes Etc. \"Every manager and executive will recognize themselves
    somewhere in this book. Lencioni distills the problems that keep even the most
    talented teams from realizing their full potential. Even more important, he shows-in
    prose that is crisp, clear, and fun to read-how to solve them.\" --Geoffrey A.
    Moore, chairman, The Chasm Group; author, \"Crossing the Chasm, Inside the Tornado,\"\
    \ and \"Living on the Fault Line\" \"This book is as thought-provoking, insightful,
    and rich with ideas as The Five Temptations of a CEO. I've used it with my team
    and it works!\" --Phillip J. Hildebrand, executive vice president and chief distribution
    officer, New York Life Insurance Company \"Compelling and incisive, this will
    become the definitive guide on how to build and manage successful teams.\" --Jean
    Kovacs, president and CEO, Comergent Technologies \"As practical, readable and
    compelling as his other books. I'm sure this will be another business classic.\""

  description:
    Connecting with other people, finding a sense of belonging and the
    need for support are natural human desires. Employees who don't feel supported
    at work don't stay around for long - or if they do, they quickly become unmotivated
    and unhappy. At a time when organisational structures are flattening and workforces
    are increasingly fluid, supporting and connecting people is more important than
    ever. This is where organisational communities of practice come in. Communities
    of practice have many valuable benefits. They include accelerating professional
    development; breaking down organisational silos; enabling knowledge sharing and
    management; building better practice; helping to hire and retain staff; and making
    people happier. In this book, Emily Webber shares her learning from personal experiences
    of building successful communities of practice within organisations. And along
    the way, she gives practical guidance on creating your own.

  authors:

  publishedDate: "2011-01-04"
  description:
    "A New York Times Bestseller In latest bestseller, Atul Gawande shows
    what the simple idea of the checklist reveals about the complexity of our lives
    and how we can deal with it. The modern world has given us stupendous know-how.
    Yet avoidable failures continue to plague us in health care, government, the law,
    the financial industry--in almost every realm of organized activity. And the reason
    is simple: the volume and complexity of knowledge today has exceeded our ability
    as individuals to properly deliver it to people--consistently, correctly, safely.
    We train longer, specialize more, use ever-advancing technologies, and still we
    fail. Atul Gawande makes a compelling argument that we can do better, using the
    simplest of methods: the checklist. In riveting stories, he reveals what checklists
    can do, what they can't, and how they could bring about striking improvements
    in a variety of fields, from medicine and disaster recovery to professions and
    businesses of all kinds. And the insights are making a difference. Already, a
    simple surgical checklist from the World Health Organization designed by following
    the ideas described here has been adopted in more than twenty countries as a standard
    for care and has been heralded as \"the biggest clinical invention in thirty years\"\
    \ (The Independent)."

  description:
    '"The average human lifespan is absurdly, outrageously, insultingly
    brief: if you live to 80, you have about four thousand weeks on earth. How should
    we use them best? Of course, nobody needs telling that there isn''t enough time.
    We''re obsessed by our lengthening to-do lists, our overfilled inboxes, the struggle
    against distraction, and the sense that our attention spans are shrivelling. Yet
    we rarely make the conscious connection that these problems only trouble us in
    the first place thanks to the ultimate time-management problem: the challenge
    of how best to use our four thousand weeks. Four Thousand Weeks is an uplifting,
    engrossing and deeply realistic exploration of this problem that draws on philosophy,
    literature and psychology to cover the past, present and future of our battles
    with time. It goes far beyond practical tips, and its many revelations will transform
    the reader''s worldview. Drawing on the insights of ancient philosophers, Benedictine
    monks, artists and authors, Scandinavian social reformers, renegade Buddhist technologists
    and many others, Oliver Burkeman sets out to realign our relationship with time
    - and in doing so, to liberate us from its grasp"--Publisher''s description.'

  description:
    In this stunning follow-up to his best-selling book, The Five Temptations
    of a CEO, Patrick Lencioni offers up another leadership fable that's every bit
    as compelling and illuminating as its predecessor. This time, Lencioni's focus
    is on a leader's crucial role in building a healthy organization--an often overlooked
    but essential element of business life that is the linchpin of sustained success.
    Readers are treated to a story of corporate intrigue as the frustrated head of
    one consulting firm faces a leadership challenge so great that it threatens to
    topple his company, his career, and everything he holds true about leadership
    itself. In the story's telling, Lencioni helps his readers understand the disarming
    simplicity and power of creating organizational health, and reveals four key disciplines
    that they can follow to achieve it.

  description:
    'From the New York Times bestselling author of The No Asshole Rule
    ''I am frequently asked, "Tom, my brother/sister/friend is taking on a new leadership
    role. What should they read?" I always respond the same way, by recommending
    one and only one book: Bob Sutton''s Good Boss, Bad Boss'' - Tom Peters, New York
    Times bestselling author of In Search of Excellence. Good Boss, Bad Boss was inspired
    by the thousands of emails, calls and conversations that Robert Sutton received
    after publishing his bestseller The No Asshole Rule - he found that most of the
    stories and cries for help he received revolved around one central figure in every
    workplace: THE BOSS. Sutton''s subsequent research showed that the success of every
    boss depended heavily on how well (or badly) they managed those they worked with
    and in Good Boss, Bad Boss he demonstrates this by weaving together the best psychological
    and management secrets with true stories, to reveal the mindset and moves of the
    best bosses, and contrasts them with the behaviour of the worst. If you want to
    understand how the best bosses think and act so that you can get better at your
    job or find a better boss to work for, Good Boss, Bad Boss has all the answers.'

  title: Scrum – A Pocket Guide
  authors:
    - Gunther Verheyen
  publishedDate: "2013-11-04"
  description:
    "This pocket guide is the one book to read for everyone who wants to
    learn about Scrum. The book covers all roles, rules and the main principles underpinning
    Scrum, and is based on the Scrum Guide Edition 2013. A broader context to this
    fundamental description of Scrum is given by describing the past and the future
    of Scrum. The author, Gunther Verheyen, has created a concise, yet complete and
    passionate reference about Scrum. The book demonstrates his core view that Scrum
    is about a journey, a journey of discovery and fun. He designed the book to be
    a helpful guide on that journey. Ken Schwaber, Scrum co-creator says that this
    book currently is the best available description of Scrum around. The book combines
    some rare characteristics: • It describes Scrum in its entirety, yet places it
    in a broader context (of past and future). • The author focuses on the subject,
    Scrum, in a way that it truly supports the reader. The book has a language and
    style in line with the philosophy of Scrum. • The book shows the playfulness of
    Scrum. David Starr and Ralph Jocham, Professional Scrum trainers and early agile
    adopters, say that this is the ultimate book to be advised as follow-up book to
    the students they teach Scrum to and to teams and managers of organizations that
    they coach Scrum to."

    "JavaScript is a powerful, object-based scripting language that can
    be embedded directly in HTML pages. It allows you to create dynamic, interactive
    Web-based applications that run completely within a Web browser -- JavaScript
    is the language of choice for developing Dynamic HTML (DHTML) content. JavaScript
    can be integrated effectively with CGI and Java to produce sophisticated Web applications,
    although, in many cases, JavaScript eliminates the need for complex CGI scripts
    and Java applets altogether. The JavaScript Pocket Reference is a companion volume
    to JavaScript: The Definitive Guide. This small book, covering JavaScript 1.2,
    is a handy reference guide to this popular language for Web development. It provides
    a complete overview of the core JavaScript language and contains summaries of
    both core and client-side objects, methods, and properties."

  description:
    When Richard Rumelt's Good Strategy/Bad Strategy was published in 2011,
    it immediately struck a chord, calling out as bad strategy the mish-mash of pop
    culture, motivational slogans and business buzz speak so often and misleadingly
    masquerading as the real thing.Since then, his original and pragmatic ideas have
    won fans around the world and continue to help readers to recognise and avoid
    the elements of bad strategy and adopt good, action-oriented strategies that honestly
    acknowledge the challenges being faced and offer straightforward approaches to
    overcoming them. Strategy should not be equated with ambition, leadership, vision
    or planning; rather, it is coherent action backed by an argument.For Rumelt, the
    heart of good strategy is insight into the hidden power in any situation, and
    into an appropriate response - whether launching a new product, fighting a war
    or putting a man on the moon. Drawing on examples of the good and the bad from
    across all sectors and all ages, he shows how this insight can be cultivated with
    a wide variety of tools that lead to better thinking and better strategy, strategy
    that cuts through the hype and gets results.

  description:
    Right Your Software and Transform Your Career Righting Software presents
    the proven, structured, and highly engineered approach to software design that
    renowned architect Juval Löwy has practiced and taught around the world. Although
    companies of every kind have successfully implemented his original design ideas
    across hundreds of systems, these insights have never before appeared in print.
    Based on first principles in software engineering and a comprehensive set of matching
    tools and techniques, Löwy's methodology integrates system design and project
    design. First, he describes the primary area where many software architects fail
    and shows how to decompose a system into smaller building blocks or services,
    based on volatility. Next, he shows how to flow an effective project design from
    the system design; how to accurately calculate the project duration, cost, and
    risk; and how to devise multiple execution options. The method and principles
    in Righting Software apply regardless of your project and company size, technology,
    platform, or industry. Löwy starts the reader on a journey that addresses the
    critical challenges of software development today by righting software systems
    and projects as well as careers-and possibly the software industry as a whole.
    Software professionals, architects, project leads, or managers at any stage of
    their career will benefit greatly from this book, which provides guidance and
    knowledge that would otherwise take decades and many projects to acquire. Register
    your book for convenient access to downloads, updates, and/or corrections as they

  title: Transactional Analysis Coaching
  authors:
    - Karen Pratt
  publishedDate: "2021"
  description:
    This important book distils the essence of developmental Transactional
    Analysis (TA) frameworks that are most useful to bring alive professional coaching
    competencies. Karen Pratt offers clear outlines of TA frameworks as well as describing
    how they are applied in coaching, with snippets of coaching conversations as illustrations
    of the theory in practice. Pratt highlights key TA frameworks in enough detail
    to be easily grasped but with a focus on application in coaching and other developmental
    conversations. A TA approach powerfully guides coaches in their listening and
    questioning. TA is not used as a coaching 'technique' - it offers psychological
    understanding of human beings and the meaning they make of who they are in the
    world. Such awareness is key for both professionals and clients in meaningful
    partnerships for development. Transactional Analysis Coaching will be key reading
    for professionals working within present-centered contracts for change - coaches,
    trainers, facilitators, supervisors, teachers, mentors and managers - seeking
    to understand how TA can impact their development. It will be of great interest
    to coaches in training and will provide a useful resource for clients in their
    ongoing development.

  description:
    "The secret to work relationships that sing from a top thought-leader
    in coaching Have you ever had the experience of working with someone and they
    just didn't “get” you? They do all the things that wind you up, put you off and
    drive you nuts. And have you ever worked with someone and you just didn't “get”
    them? You couldn't figure out what made them tick, and you know you were underwhelming
    as a manager and leader for them. Of course, you have. We all have. Why do those
    experiences keep happening? Particularly when we’ve also experienced the opposite:
    great working relationships that soar. In How To Work with (Almost) Anyone, internationally
    bestselling author Michael Bungay Stanier (MBS) shares a tested process that sets
    up working relationships for the best possible success. It shows you how to communicate
    about who you are and what brings out the best and the worst in you. It gives
    you the tools to talk with your colleagues about how you operate, and to set a
    social contract for how you’ll work together (not just what you’ll be working
    on). It teaches you how to keep relationships strong and healthy, clear and clean.
    Not every relationship can be rainbows and unicorns and free-flowing ginger beer.
    But everyone who relates can do a better job at amplifying the best of each other,
    navigating the dark spots, and staying generous. With How To Work with (Almost)
    Anyone, MBS reveals the secret to better, more successful relationships."

  publishedDate: "2018-12-04"
  description:
    'Surprising ways we limit ourselves and our happiness, and how to challenge
    the internalized wisdom and circular thinking that holds us back As women, many
    of us are stuck in feedback loops about how to be successful and happy: striving
    to "have it all" at work and at home, letting ourselves be pressured into giving
    every part of our lives 100% until we''re completely burnt-out, imagining only
    a strictly linear life path (college, job, marriage, kids), and accepting limitations
    without question. Yet the truth is, this book argues, most of the conventional
    wisdom about driving our life choices is total baloney. In Everything Is Negotiable,
    Meg Myers Morgan deconstructs preconceived notions about adulthood, parenthood,
    and career paths that have us limiting ourselves. Instead of following that linear
    plan, for example, she urges readers to take action now for what we want--limitations
    be damned. With wit and verve, Morgan also tells us to forget trying to "have
    it all," as the cliche phrase goes--it''ll never happen. And, Morgan argues, don''t
    bother trying to give 100%--we simply can''t give anything 100% attention, ever!
    Instead, this book teaches us to navigate life''s necessary trade-offs free of
    the baggage of our own expectations. Chock full of strategies for where and when
    to give our limited energy, what to demand from our careers, and how to make better
    choices, Everything Is Negotiable is for women ready to seize the lives they really
    want.'

  description:
    Most of us mindlessly drift from bed to phone to fridge to work in
    the morning. Yet the choices we make during the first few hours of our day have
    an outsized effect on everything else. In My Morning Routine,talented creatives
    and successful business people share their secrets to unlocking greater energy,
    focus and calm - starting first thing in the morning. For example, Arianna Huffington
    describes how she silences the 'bad roommate' of self-doubt every morning; Google's
    M.G. Siegler reveals why he religiously drinks bottled Starbucks Frappucinos;
    and a former Navy SEAL lieutenant explains why his morning workout routine changes
    each season. From sleep patterns and dietary preferences to electronics use, workout
    rituals and more leisurely and self-indulgent habits, Benjamin Spall and Michael
    Xander present readers with a wide range of possible practices to choose from.
    My Morning Routineillustrates that there is not one right way to start the day,
    but encourages you to experiment until you've formed a morning routine that works
    for you - one that makes you feel awake, alert, physically and mentally healthy
    and psyched up to have a great day.

    'Why do naturally talented people frequently fail to reach their potential
    while other far less gifted individuals go on to achieve amazing things? The secret
    to outstanding achievement is not talent, but a passionate persistence. In other
    words, grit. MacArthur Genius Award-winning psychologist Angela Duckworth shares
    fascinating new revelations about who succeeds in life and why. Based on her cutting-edge
    research, Duckworth shows how many people achieve remarkable things not just by
    relying on innate natural talent, but by practising what she calls grit. She then
    offers a Grit Formula to help anyone to become more gritty, focusing on six key
    factors: hope, effort, precision, passion, ritual and prioritisation. She reveals:
    - Why people who test high for talent often fail to achieve their potential, and
    why people who do not test high for talent often "overachieve" what others expect
    them to do - How grit can be learned, whatever your IQ or circumstances - Why
    stubbornness is a key characteristic of gritty people - When to be stubborn and
    when giving up is the grittiest thing you can do - How gritty people found their
    passion, and you can find yours - How gritty experts practise, and how you can
    do the same in your own life - What the people who care about you can do to boost
    your grit when you need it most - How grit is cultivated in the highest-performing
    sports teams, companies and schools'

    AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER!! Named a Best Book of 2019 by
    TIME, Amazon, and The Washington Post A Wired Must-Read Book of Summer “Gretchen
    McCulloch is the internet’s favorite linguist, and this book is essential reading.
    Reading her work is like suddenly being able to see the matrix.” —Jonny Sun, author
    of everyone's a aliebn when ur a aliebn too Because Internet is for anyone who's
    ever puzzled over how to punctuate a text message or wondered where memes come
    from. It's the perfect book for understanding how the internet is changing the
    English language, why that's a good thing, and what our online interactions reveal
    about who we are. Language is humanity's most spectacular open-source project,
    and the internet is making our language change faster and in more interesting
    ways than ever before. Internet conversations are structured by the shape of our
    apps and platforms, from the grammar of status updates to the protocols of comments
    and @replies. Linguistically inventive online communities spread new slang and
    jargon with dizzying speed. What's more, social media is a vast laboratory of
    unedited, unfiltered words where we can watch language evolve in real time. Even
    the most absurd-looking slang has genuine patterns behind it. Internet linguist
    Gretchen McCulloch explores the deep forces that shape human language and influence
    the way we communicate with one another. She explains how your first social internet
    experience influences whether you prefer "LOL" or "lol," why ~sparkly tildes~
    succeeded where centuries of proposals for irony punctuation had failed, what
    emoji have in common with physical gestures, and how the artfully disarrayed language
    of animal memes like lolcats and doggo made them more likely to spread.

  authors:
    - David Mitchell
  publishedDate: 2020-09
  description:
    David Mitchell's 2014 bestseller Thinking About It Only Makes It Worse
    must really have made people think - because everything's got worse. We've gone
    from UKIP surge to Brexit shambles, from horsemeat in lasagne to Donald Trump
    in the White House, from Woolworths going under to all the other shops going under.
    It's probably socially irresponsible even to try to cheer up. But if you're determined
    to give it a go, you might enjoy this eclectic collection (or eclection) of David
    Mitchell's attempts to make light of all that darkness. Scampi, politics, the
    Olympics, terrorism, exercise, rude street names, inheritance tax, salad cream,
    proportional representation and farts are all touched upon by Mitchell's unremitting
    laser of chit-chat, as he negotiates a path between the commercialisation of Christmas
    and the true spirit of Halloween. Read this book and slightly change your life!

  title: Impact Engineering (Complete Omnibus)
  authors:
    - Junade Ali
  publishedDate: "2024-07-14"
  description:
    “This has touched a nerve” - The Register This is a book people don’t
    want you to read. In “How to Protect Yourself from Killer Computers”, Dr Junade
    Ali peeled back the layers of cover-up, negligence and wrongdoing to uncover how
    killer computers are born and how everyone can protect themselves, as the powerful
    institutions implicated attempted to shutdown coverage of the case studies. Then
    in “Impact Engineering”, Dr Ali took on the “cult following” of the Agile software
    development methodology with new research into what truly enables success in software
    projects alongside personal and organisational transformations. Ferocious shutdown
    attempts including stalking led to the book becoming an Amazon Best Seller on
    launch week. Now, this Complete Omnibus edition of “Impact Engineering” contains
    both previous books alongside a new epilogue closing the work. “Leaders that fail
    to deal with such failures transparently leave their organisations vulnerable
    to existential risk.” - Forbes “Junade Ali's research has also found basic problems
    shared across various sectors.” - The Independent “Through the years, Ali became
    adept at not only software engineering but understanding how software engineers
    work. In addition to developer burnout, he’s focused on quality, continuous improvement
    and psychological safety in the workplace.” - EE Times “With a decade’s experience
    building high-reliability systems for critical applications in transport and other
    industries, Ali has seen all too often how institutions double down on the assumption
    that they are correct” - Australian Computer Society Information Age “His many
    contributions to IT security include developing cyber security techniques that
    have been adopted in products built by Apple and Google, and developing software
    to help de-escalate cyber warfare situations.” - Computer Weekly
