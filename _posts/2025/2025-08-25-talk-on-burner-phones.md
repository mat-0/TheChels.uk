> Next, we discussed why your smartphone is risky and how you can improve it today, even without a burner phone. We covered how device IDs -- the IMSI tied to your SIM and cell tower access, and the IMEI tied to your hardware -- make true phone anonymity nearly impossible.  We also outlined four broad categories of data your phone collects and how each can be exposed
- _Identity & finance_: payments, contracts, phone numbers, and digital IDs. 
- _Location & movement_: GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cell towers, and sensors, exposed by spyware, stalkerware, tower dumps, and data brokers.
- _Communications & social graph_: calls, texts, and contacts, exposed through spyware, stalkerware, and forensic tools.
- _Content & storage_: accounts, apps, photos, backups, and local files, exposed by spyware, forensic tools like Cellebrite and GrayKey, and cloud subpoenas.

## Privacy Tips for All Phones

1. **Keep device & OS as updated as possible**
2. **Strong PIN, not biometrics**
3. **Disable cloud backups / use encrypted backups**
4. **Install Signal**
5. **Enforce strict app permissions (deny mic, camera, location) unless needed**
6. **Radios off (GPS/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth) unless needed**
7. **Store minimal sensitive data (including photos) **

_For Android specifically_: Disable Google Location History & ad personalization, use Firefox or Brave instead of Chrome, restrict Gemini / Google Assistant, consider F-Droid for trusted apps, consider GrapheneOS or CalyxOS.

_For iPhones specifically_: Enable Ask App Not to Track, restrict Siri & Apple Intelligence, erase after 10 failed passcode attempts, use Lockdown Mode (iOS 16+) if high-risk.

> During the discussion, we clarified that SIM cards do not store photos or emails, though they may hold a small number of contacts or text logs depending on carrier settings. We also explained that a fully powered-down phone should not be transmitting data to towers, but its absence of activity can itself raise suspicion by inference. Voiceprints also came up: your voice can be used as a biometric identifier, and while apps may slightly alter audio, your vocal patterns remain a relatively unique marker. Participants also asked about carriers, encryption, and evidence. We reviewed carrier data retention schedules, noted that data brokers track which carrier your number is currently using, and discussed the limits of Fourth Amendment and warrant protections.

## Burner Phones

From there, we moved into the "off the grid" options and mapped out a taxonomy of what people mean by a burner phone. We talked through four main categories:

- _Prepaid or repurposed phones: _Cheap and flexible, but still tower-tracked and vulnerable to forensic phone breaking. Some can support Signal. 
- _SIM rotation_: Rotating SIMs manually or using PGPP eSIMs changes your IMSI, though your IMEI stays constant.
- _Minimal or dumb phones_: Fewer apps, but limited functionality and no encryption. Staying off social more is still a win. 
- _Device disguises_: Tools like VoIP numbers, VPNs, or hotspots can obscure identifiers but still leave metadata trails.

Each of these offers some protection, though none guarantees anonymity.

**Universal Burner Phone Set Up: **

1. **Buy phone & service in cash**
2. **Do not share your email, phone number, or ID with carriers or clerks when activating service**
3. **Set up with public Wi-Fi**
4. **No personal accounts, no contact imports, no being yourself on the device**
5. **Do tips 1--7 for all devices above, but minimize radios/app permissions/photos as much as possible (or you may compromise your burner)**
6. **Rotate your SIM (physical or with PGPP; carrier eSIM changes leave a trail)**
7. **Treat as disposable**

> Throughout the discussion, I emphasized three key lessons: IMSI and IMEI still make true anonymity difficult, every option provides some protection if matched to the right risks, and how you set up and use the phone matters as much as buying it.
