As it turns out. Markdown _is_ the new gold.

> Nothing beats a folder full of markdown files
> Obsidian reinforces a lesson I’ve learned from my last decade and a half of blogging; nothing beats a folder full of markdown files. A note-taking app doesn’t have to be complex machinery. A little bit of YAML frontmatter can go a long way.

> This migration identified one subtle problem I didn’t know I had; I “over-databased” in Notion. I created entire sections in Notion with a database to get the editable table UI. This creates a lot of click-thru flows, excess documents, and feels like building an entire CMS for a one-page website. Obsidian nudges me to think more simple.
