I like the simplicity of The Browser Company’s second browser. I had been using Arc as my primary browser as I preferred the left hand side tabs - particularly on my 34’ screen - for around a year.

Dia is a step back in feature set and an easy take is its chrome with chat GPT on the side. This largely true, but I can see huge value if you live on tabs and so it has your context. 

This would be perfect for researchers both academic and creatives looking for their next long read as well as students.

I’m not yet convinced it’s the breakthrough I need, however it’s my default browser for now as the simplicity is there. I almost always have a dozen pinned tabs open, half a dozen others - it’s easy to ask questions on what’s open.

I also like some the prompt actions called Skills e.g., /morning gives me a daily rundown of news and eeather although this could improve over time. It uses my open tabs first and then broader internet context. For example I ask for a weather update and it fails, yet one of my tabs is my own site with a weather forecast on it. 

I have adding /osint <name, location> for a decent factsheet about people, /tasks for identify things/actions to take from my open tabs (often github issues, news articles of interest)
