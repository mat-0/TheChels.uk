title: Is Raycast still European-owned
cited: Reddit User

---

I thought this was an interesting position, coinciding with a piece on the Tech Meme Ride Home podcast.

>  Hi! I'm curious about Raycast's ownership. I know it was founded in London, but does anyone know if it's still primarily European-owned or if the majority ownership has shifted to American investors? I'm trying to reduce my reliance on American-owned products.
