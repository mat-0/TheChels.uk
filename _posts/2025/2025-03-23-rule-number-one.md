---

In any organization, fostering a culture that prioritizes people is essential. This means valuing each individual's contribution to their team, promoting inclusivity, diversity, and ensuring that everyone feels respected and heard. I encourage debate and a difference of opinion. Stifling that would be detrimental the culture we are building however, how individuals communicate with others is critical. I'm a big fan of Radical Candor, but the key part is the respect in the messaging.

## One fundamental rule that encapsulates this ethos is the simple yet powerful directive: "Don't be a dick."

Treating others with kindness and respect is fundamental in creating a positive and productive environment where everyone can thrive.
