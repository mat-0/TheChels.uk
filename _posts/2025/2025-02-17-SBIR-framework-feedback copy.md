> Putting words together to give positive feedback is hard! You know the emotions you feel but lack the words.
>
> organize my thoughts, I use the <abbr>SBIR</abbr> Framework. This acronym defines the structure of how to deliver positive feedback:
>
> - Situation: State the specific situation where you observed the behaviour.
> - Behaviour: Explain the precise behaviour you saw.
> - Impact: Describe the exact impact the personâ€™s actions had on you.
> - Request: State the explicit request you would like to make of the person.
