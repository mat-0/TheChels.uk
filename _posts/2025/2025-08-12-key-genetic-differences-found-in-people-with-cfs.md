title: Key genetic differences found in people with CFS

> The study, called [DecodeME](https://www.decodeme.org.uk/), compared DNA samples from just over 15,500 people with ME/CFS and nearly 260,000 without it, all of whom were from the UK and of European ancestry.

> "We have found eight genetic signals," says [Chris Ponting](https://edwebprofiles.ed.ac.uk/profile/chris-ponting) at the University of Edinburgh in the UK. The eight genome regions involved look significantly different in people with ME/CFS, indicating that genetic variants there contribute to the risk of developing it. The University of Edinburgh announced the findings in a press briefing, but they haven't yet been published in a journal or on a pre-print server.
