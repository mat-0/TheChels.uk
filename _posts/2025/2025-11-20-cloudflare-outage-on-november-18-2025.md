My sites were unavailable during this outage, but in all my years with Cloudflare, around a decade, I've had no issues and have yet to pay them a penny as their free tier is awesome. I pay them for domain name registration.

I primarily use Cloudflare for all my DNS, SSL, Security Headers, WAF, and caching. The outage proves the rule.
