title: Optimising for Teams

---

- We work in small cross-functional teams with a focus on collaboration
- We have psychological safety
- We Encourage open and honest feedback in a caring way ([see Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/our-approach/))
- We have trust (sharing vulnerabilities with the group)
- We Embrace conflict (utilising constructive and passionate debate over feigning agreement and "I don't mind")
- We commit (by disagreeing and committing whole-heartedly to the team decision)
- We are accountable (by calling out peers, leaders, or counterproductive behaviours to raise standards over ducking responsibility and blaming others)
- We pay attention to results (by focusing on team success over personal success, status, and ego).

> Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand. - The Prime Directive.

We take every opportunity keep people informed and to teach/coach/support our teammates.
