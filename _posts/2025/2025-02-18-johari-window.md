title: The Johari Window

---

The Johari window is a technique that helps people better understand their relationship with themselves and others.

In the exercise, subjects pick several adjectives from a list, choosing ones they feel describe their own personality. The subject's peers then get the same list, and each picks an equal number of adjectives that describe the subject. These adjectives are then inserted into a two-by-two grid of four cells.

## The Four Quadrants

### Open, or Arena

> Adjectives that both the subject and peers select go in this cell (or quadrant) of the grid. These are traits that subject and peers perceive.

### Hidden, or FaÃ§ade

> Adjectives selected by the subject, but not by any of their peers, go in this quadrant. These are things the peers are either unaware of, or that are untrue but for the subject's claim.

### Blind Spot

> Adjectives not selected by subjects, but only by their peers go here. These represent what others perceive but the subject does not.

### Unknown

> Adjectives that neither subject nor peers selected go here. They represent subject's behaviors or motives that no one participating recognizes - either because they do not apply or because of collective ignorance of these traits.
