Redis 8 is now GA, loaded with new features and more than 30 performance improvements

This release adds 8 more data structures, including vector set (beta), JSON, time series, and five probabilistic structures, including Bloom filter, cuckoo filter, count-min sketch, top-k, and t-digest (some previously available as separate Redis modules). These new data structures help you solve your current use cases better and build for the next generation of fast and real-time apps. 

Additionally, we’ve changed the name of our free product from Redis Community Edition to Redis Open Source to reflect the addition of AGPLv3 as a licensing option.
