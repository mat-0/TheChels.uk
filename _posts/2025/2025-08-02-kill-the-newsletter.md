> How does Kill the Newsletter! work?
> Create a feed with the form above and Kill the Newsletter! provides you with an email address and an Atom feed. Emails that are received at that address are turned into entries in that feed. Sign up to a newsletter with that address and use your feed reader to subscribe to that feed.
> 
> How do I confirm my newsletter subscription?
> In most cases when you subscribe to a newsletter the newsletter publisher sends you an email with a confirmation link. Kill the Newsletter! converts that email into a feed entry as usual, so it appears in your feed reader and you may follow the confirmation link from there. Some newsletter publishers want you to reply to an email using the address that subscribed to the newsletter. Unfortunately Kill the Newsletter! doesnâ€™t support this scenario, but you may contact the newsletter publisher and ask them to verify you manually. As a workaround, some people have had success with signing up for the newsletter using their regular email address and setting up a filter to forward the emails to Kill the Newsletter!
