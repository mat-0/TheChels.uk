> The order in which we should focus is people, principles, process, and then product. You have to get the people right first. Then you decide on the principles that you are going to follow, i.e. what is your team's culture. Once those are established, you fix the processes. Then finally, once all of that groundwork is laid, you can get down to fixing the product. Today, I want to walk through why I think this order is the correct way to approach situations, especially when we start new roles, start new initiatives, or need to pivot to something new.
