> We've chosen the term "Continuous AI" to align with the established concept of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Just as CI/CD transformed software development by automating integration and deployment, Continuous AI covers the ways in which AI can be used to automate and enhance collaboration workflows.
>
> "Continuous AI" is not a term GitHub owns, nor a technology GitHub builds: it's a term we use to focus our minds, and which we're introducing to the industry. This means Continuous AI is an open-ended set of activities, workloads, examples, recipes, technologies and capabilities; a category, rather than any single tool.
