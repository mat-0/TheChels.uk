title: Olio - Community Food Sharing and Waste Reduction

---

Rejoined* Olio and gifted 28 items to local people saving them from landfill.

- I delete my accounts when not in use in a digital hygiene and minimalism approach.

I would recommend this to anyone aiming to be more sustainable, having a surplus of food and non-food items to give or if you are in need of a wide variety of items - in conjunction with food banks etc
