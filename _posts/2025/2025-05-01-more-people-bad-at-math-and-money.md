> Almost 9 million people in the UK remain significantly underpensioned compared to the broader population. The latest data reveals that underpensioned groups have annual private pension incomes ranging from £3,650 to £6,750. This is 43% to 80% compared to the population average of £8,500, leaving many individuals vulnerable to financial insecurity in retirement.
