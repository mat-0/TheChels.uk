> **NLWeb** simplifies the process of building conversational interfaces for websites. It natively supports MCP (Model Context Protocol), allowing the same natural language APIs to serve both humans and AI agents.

> Schema.org and related semi-structured formats like RSS -- used by over 100 million websites -- have become not just de facto syndication mechanisms, but also a semantic layer for the web. NLWeb leverages these to enable natural language interfaces more easily.
