> As one step in reducing the overhead of sharing documents widely, I wrote up and shared this recommended process for providing feedback on documents:
>
> 1. Before starting, remember that the goal of providing feedback on a document is to help the author. Optimizing for anything else, even if it’s a worthy cause, discourages authors from sharing their future writing. If you prioritize something other than helping the author, you are discouraging them from sharing future work.
>
> 2. Start by skimming the document to understand its structure and where various kinds of topics are addressed. Why? This helps avoid giving feedback on ways the document’s actual structure diverges from how you imagined it would be structured. It also reduces questions about topics that are answered later in the document.
>
> 3. Both of these sorts of feedback are a distraction during a discussion on a tech spec. In general, it’s better to avoid them. If you notice an author making the same significant structural mistake over several ADRs, it’s worth delivering that feedback separately. After skimming, reread the document, leaving comments with concerns. Each comment should include these details:
>
>    - What your suggested change or concern is
>    - Why you believe this is meaningful to address
>    - How important this seems (from ignorable nitpick to critical)
>
> 4. If you find yourself leaving more than three or four issues, then you should either raise your threshold for commenting or you should schedule time with the individual to talk over the feedback. If the document is unreasonably weak, then it’s appropriate to nudge their leadership to dig into what’s happening on that team.
