> The plan published today provides the foundations for significant improvements in all key areas that affect people living with ME/CFS in England, many of whom currently struggle to access appropriate care tailored to their complex condition.

> As a priority, the plan will introduce new training for NHS healthcare professionals, featuring up-to-date learning resources to increase understand and ensure signs aren't missed. This will help combat the stigma faced by people living with ME/CFS, which stems from a lack of awareness about the condition.

> The rollout of neighbourhood health services as set out in the government's 10 Year Health Plan will also see ME/CFS patients able to access care closer to home, with specially-trained staff able to support those with complex needs.

Minister for Public Health and Prevention, Ashley Dalton, said: 

> ME/CFS is a debilitating illness that can severely limit patients' ability to participate in everyday activities, maintain employment, or enjoy family and social life. 
> 
> Today's plan will help tackle the stigma and lack of awareness of this condition through improved training for NHS staff.
> 
> And through our neighbourhood health services, we will ensure patients suffering from the effects of ME/CFS can access quality care, closer to home, as pledged in our 10 Year Health Plan.
> 
> Our Plan for Change is transforming how patients experience care and this plan represents a comprehensive approach to addressing the long-standing gaps in care and support for people with these conditions, with patient access to appropriate care at its heart.

Sonya Chowdhury, Chief Executive, Action for ME said:

> This is an important step for the ME community, long overlooked and under-served. The Plan must not be a token gesture--it requires a sustained, strategic commitment to care, funding, and research. Without it, meaningful outcomes for people with ME will not be achieved.

The plan includes increased funding for research, awarded through the National Institute for Health and Care Research, into how existing medicines can be used to for ME/CFS. This initiative aims to give patients access to a wider range of potential treatments.
