title: Four habits that derail listening

---

> Listening is a key attribute of a coach, leader, team member and colleague. Consider the feelings of what is being said and not just the words used. Listen to the pauses. Listen to how things people are saying and not just what they are saying.
    
## Dramatic listener
    
They get engrossed in the emotion and want to be come an actor in it. Dramatic listeners tend to get caught up in the problem som much so they they don't hear the idea or the solution. They may come away from an interaction feeling like they have really connected when in fact, they have not.
    
## Interrupting listener
    
We notice these people the most. They are coming from a place of concern and tend to listens to fix and solve the problem. They finish sentences wrongly and many listen for places to jump in as much as they are listening for the words. They can often appear busy or in a rush, they value time differently so interrupt in a hope of getting to the point or perceived solution sooner.
    
## Lost listener
    
These listeners tend to zone out and appear disinterested or not present. Lost listeners may be focused on something else. Technology devices have the potential to distract them substantially. They may make noises of encouragement to continue. Question why they are there in the first place - If there is no value for them then allow them to leave.
    
## Shrewd listener
    
These listeners are solving the current problem and also the next problem. They may create problems in their own mind that are not even what the speaker said. They are smart enough not to interrupt, and often appear very engaged, but are not necessarily listening.
