> If you've spent any time measuring value streams, you know that coding isn't usually the problem. Having a clean flow of good information about the problems we are trying to solve is usually the problem. Not having a safe and fast way to deliver changes and get feedback on the quality of our ideas is also very common. I've yet to see an improvement effort that required us to focus on the coding part of the flow before fixing the upstream and downstream issues.
