Apple seem to have a track record of over promising and failing to deliver on their own deadlines. At least they are working to get the quality right.



> Here's a statement I got this morning from Apple spokeswoman Jacqueline Roy, verbatim:

> > "Siri helps our users find what they need and get things done quickly, and in just the past six months, we've made Siri more conversational, introduced new features like type to Siri and product knowledge, and added an integration with ChatGPT. We've also been working on a more personalized Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It's going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year."
