> I have a set of questions I ask in some variation at the end of my 1:1s.
> - What are you taking away?
> - What was most useful to you?
> These two I got from my coach and I use them both at work and in my own coaching. The concrete questions are useful, but it can also be a source of implicit feedback about what was useful / what was less useful.
> - Is there anything I can help you with or do for you?
> It’s amazing to me how often this starts another conversation about what someone needs help with. I also like that it frames asking for help as a normal thing.
> - Is there anything I can be doing better?
> - Is there anything I do that you particularly appreciate?
> I ask these more periodically because I want it to be unexpected enough that people actually think about it and try to give me an answer. The second question is useful for getting at least some specifics if the first one doesn’t elicit any information.
> 
> - Is there anything that I didn’t ask you that I should have?
> - If I made you complain about one thing, what would it be?
> Useful for flipping someone’s thinking around if I feel like there may be things I’m missing.
