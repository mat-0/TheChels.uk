title: Optimising for openness and transparency

---

- We provide feedback on progress, challenges, blockers and issues early and often such that anyone is abreast of the current situation.
- Everyone strives and collectively collaborates for the common organizational objective, and no one has any hidden agenda
- We use different communication media for the benefit of group, e.g., follow up documentation, Teams posts, minutes from verbal chats.
- We are open with each other when we are unsure or find complexity or difficulty
- We over-communicate given many work in a remote setting, we follow-up and check understanding
- We are transparent and use facts as is. ([transparency](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/three-pillars-empiricism-scrum))
