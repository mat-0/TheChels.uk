title: Confidence and Competence

---

- Let people go when they are both confident and competent. If they know what they're doing then you can set goals and get out of the way.

- Coach people when they are competent but lack confidence. If they're good but they don't know it then support them in finding the answers themselves.

- Retrain people who are confident but not actually competent. If they think they’re good, but they’re actually not, it’s time to take them back to re-learn the thing they’re doing.

- Direct people who really don’t know what they’re doing. If they’re doing something new and unfamiliar it’s fine to step in and tell them how to do it.
