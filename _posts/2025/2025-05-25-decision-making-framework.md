1. The OODA Loop

    - Observe → Orient → Decide → Act
    - A powerful cycle for rapid, adaptive decisions in changing landscapes.

2. Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)

    - Focus on the 20% of actions yielding 80% of your results.
    - Success isn't about more activity; it's about the right activity.
    - Regularly reassess to ensure you're focusing on the right 20%.

3. Amazon Door Framework

    Classify decisions:
    - One-way doors: Irreversible. Go slow, be thorough.
    - Two-way doors: Reversible. Decide quickly, iterate.
    - Most are two-way. Don't treat them like they're set in stone.

4. First Principles Thinking

    - Break problems down to their absolute basic truths. Then rebuild your solution from that solid ground.
    - Magic comes from questioning every assumption.

5. Eisenhower Matrix

    - Urgent + Important: Do now
    - nImportant, not urgent: Schedule
    - Urgent, not important: Delegate
    - Neither: Eliminate

6. Inversion Thinking

    - Instead of "How do I succeed?" ask: "How could this fail?" Then avoid those pitfalls.

7. Regret Minimization

    - Show applied learning, like "Mastered AI and used it to boost user satisfaction 28%," not just "Learned AI."
