title: Dreyfus Model - Skill Acquisition and Learning Stages

---

- Novice - rigid adherence to taught rules or plans
- Advanced Beginner - Needs small, frequent rewards; limited "situational perception"
- Competent - Can develop conceptual models, can troubleshoot
- Proficient - Driven to seek larger conceptual model, can self-correct
- Expert - Intuitive grasp of situations based on deep, tacit understanding, monitoring awareness
- Mastery - Holistic recognition, intuitive decision making, absorbed awareness

The goal with embracing Agile practices should always to put the users/customers at the forefront of the decision-making process, to inspect and adapt to quickly learn what is working and what isn't, and to deliver useable things as quickly as possible to those users to get their feedback. To deliver this well, you need a high functioning, trusting team, and this typically requires some structural changes to enable teams to be set up like this from the beginning. That can take some time or multiple iterations before organizations are able to do their best agile work.
