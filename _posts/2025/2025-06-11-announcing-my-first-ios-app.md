Iâ€™m delighted to announce my first iOS app has been published to the App Store.

The app is a note taking companion app for bloggers who use Jekyll, the static site generator.

Notes or items, are saved to iCloud - one can then pick them up on a Mac and copy them into a git repo and commit them.

There is also an export function which opens the share sheet - which then can let the user copy the file into the <workingcopy.app> space and commit the file on the go.

There is an annual subscription and one off tips available, as well as bunch of customisable and accessible features.
