A couple of songs came up sequentially today that seemed appropriate for the times.

> There are some bad people on the rise
> They're saving their own skins by
> Ruining people's lives

- Interesting Drug, Morrissey

> But the leaders of the free world
> Are just little boys throwin' stones
> And it's easy to ignore
> Till they're knockin' on the door of your homes, oh yeah

- Leaders of the free world, Elbow
