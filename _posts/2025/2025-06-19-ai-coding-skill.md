> AI-assisted coding for teams that can't get away with vibes
>
> Atharva notes that AI is a multiplier: the more expertise you have in software engineering, the better the results you can get from LLMs. Furthermore, _what helps the human helps the AI_.
>
> This means good test coverage, automatic linting, continuous integration and deployment, good documentation practices and "clearly defined features, broken down into multiple small story cards".
>
> If a team has all of this stuff in place, AI coding assistants will be able to operate more reliably and collaborate more effectively with their human overseers.
