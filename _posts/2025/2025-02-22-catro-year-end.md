As a big fan of the Castro app I'm also happy with the performance improvements over the last year under new ownership. I don't feel like I am missing entire podcasts in my feed any more... been subscribed to over 230 makes it hard to track if one stops publishing or the engine is broken. I don't have to worry about this

> Overall I'm happy with Castro's improvements over the past year, but we need to move iOS product out the door faster. That's my number one focus and hopefully you will start to see those efforts bear fruit soon. Until then, I thought I'd share some of the work we've done that isn't as easy for you to see but does matter a great deal.
