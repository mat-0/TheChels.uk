> The Verge today launched a suite of homepage and editorial product updates aimed at deepening its direct relationship with readers. The announcement includes a new feature that allows readers to follow topics and individual Verge journalists, view those stories in a personalized feed on the homepage, and receive them via a daily digest email. Over the next month, the site will also launch several new editorial newsletters: a daily free flagship newsletter to give readers even more options for how they access The Verge, and multiple subscriber-exclusive offerings that will join Alex Heath’s Command Line and Tom Warren’s Notepad as part of The Verge’s paid subscription.
>
> This update builds on the work of The Verge’s 2022 homepage redesign, and reflects the brand’s continued investment in building habit, loyalty, and a sustainable business model, on the heels of The Verge’s subscription product which launched in late 2024. The launch also represents the next step in The Verge’s long-term strategy to thrive in what editor-in-chief Nilay Patel has called the “Google Zero” era, when Google search stops sending traffic to publishers.
