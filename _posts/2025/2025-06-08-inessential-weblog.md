I'm glad NetNewsWire is still being developed by Brent Simmons, who has announced his retirement. Sound like he will be focusing on NetNewsWire, which is great news for the app and its users (people like me who use it daily).

> What does it mean for NetNewsWire?
> Good things! I’m not retiring from writing apps — which means I’ll have a lot more time for working on NetNewsWire.
>
> It’s been 15 years since the last time I could work on NetNewsWire during weekdays (as opposed to just nights and weekends), and I’m super-psyched for this.
