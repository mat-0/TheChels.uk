Class.

> our proposal was recommended for funding, particularly as only [36% ](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/overview)of new NSF grant applicants are successful on their first attempt. We became concerned, however, when we were presented with the terms and conditions we would be required to agree to if we accepted the grant. These terms included affirming the statement that we "do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws." This restriction would apply not only to the security work directly funded by the grant, but to any and all activity of the PSF as a whole. Further, violation of this term gave the NSF the right to "claw back" previously approved and transferred funds. This would create a situation where money we'd already spent could be taken back, which would be an enormous, open-ended financial risk. 

> Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core to the PSF's values, as committed to in our [mission statement](https://www.python.org/psf/mission/): 

> _The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of **a diverse and international community** of Python programmers._

> Given the value of the grant to the community and the PSF, we did our utmost to get clarity on the terms and to find a way to move forward in concert with our values. We consulted our NSF contacts and reviewed decisions made by other organizations in similar circumstances, particularly [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/06/announcing-withdrawal-of-nsf-pose-proposal/). 
  
> In the end, however, the PSF simply can't agree to a statement that we won't operate any programs that "advance or promote" diversity, equity, and inclusion, as it would be a betrayal of our mission and our community.
