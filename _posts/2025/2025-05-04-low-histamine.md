## Important Guidelines for Low Histamine Vegan Eating

### Fresh is Best

Prepare meals fresh and avoid leftovers whenever possible. Histamine levels increase as food ages, even in the refrigerator. Try to cook just enough for one meal at a time.

### Cooking Methods Matter

Steam, boil, or bake foods rather than frying or grilling to minimize histamine formation during the cooking process.
