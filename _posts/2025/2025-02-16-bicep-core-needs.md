cited: Paloma Medina

The bicep model is created by Paloma Medina as a way of grouping themes of core needs of humans in to six. Each individual will value them differently. Getting to know them is a shortcut to better communication, as well as greater inclusivity at work.

## Belonging

- Community: A feeling of friendship and closeness with a group, or being part of a tight community of any size.
- Community well-being: People are cared for, the whole group feels happy and healthy.
- Connection: Feeling kinship and mutual understanding with another person.

## Improvement

- Progress towards purpose: You are helping make progress towards an important goal for the company, your team or your own career/ life.

- Decision-making: The ability to make decisions about the things that matter to you.

- Access to information feels fair: All groups/ people have access to information that is relevant to them.
