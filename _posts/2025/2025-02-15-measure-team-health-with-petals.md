title: Measure team health with Petals
cited: Si Jobling

---

> In 2022, I created a simple new framework to help engineering teams become more aware of their overall health called **PETALS**. We identified and simplified to 5 key dimensions that influence team health:
>
> - **Productivity**
> - **Enjoyment**
> - **Teamwork**
> - **Learning**
> - **Stress** (or **Serenity**)
>
> By scoring each dimension out of 5, we can calculate **Averages** for that individual or across a team of scores. This then creates a simple _PETALS_ visualisation using a RAG (Red, Amber, Green) colour scheme for rapid observability and continuous improvement discussions.
