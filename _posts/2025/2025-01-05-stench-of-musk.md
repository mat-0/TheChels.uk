Just a thought; but perhaps the world's richest man should spend less time focusing on the standard of policitians in the UK and spend more time solving a number of crises in his own country not least the non-zero chance of children going to school on Monday getting murdered by a man with a semi-automatic rifle.

Also Tesla sales are below benchmarks. LOL.
