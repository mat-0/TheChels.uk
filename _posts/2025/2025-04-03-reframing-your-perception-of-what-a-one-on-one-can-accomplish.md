A well-structured one-on-one meeting with your manager isn't just a check-in, it's an opportunity to shape your work environment and career trajectory. You wouldn't build a system without evaluating its constraints, dependencies, and long-term maintainability. Why approach your career any differently?

Start by shifting your mindset: These meetings are not status updates. Your manager already sees your pull requests, sprint velocity, and planning docs. Instead, use this time to highlight _what matters_--what you've shipped, the value it's delivered, and where the friction is.

You can also use this space to validate decisions and gather context. If you're weighing different paths forward, don't just ask for approval--frame the conversation in terms of trade-offs:

> "Here are the pros and cons of refactoring this service now versus later. How does this align with our broader business goals?"

Treat your manager like a decision-making API: Feed in the relevant signals, surface what's unclear, and work together on an informed response.
