Some what dated news, but recently discovered.

> Today, Entra ID (Azure AD) MFA supports delivering one-time passcodes (OTPs) via text message. These texts get sent to the default messaging app on a user's phone depending on the phone's operating system. In many countries though, these default apps aren't users' primary messaging apps. To help deliver OTPs to users on their preferred messaging platforms, Entra ID will roll out OTP delivery to WhatsApp in select regions.

> Starting mid-September 2023, users in India, Indonesia, and New Zealand may start receiving MFA text messages via WhatsApp. Users that fit the following criteria are subject, but not guaranteed, to receive the updated experience
