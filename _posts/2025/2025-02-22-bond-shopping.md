## Scene 1: MI6 Headquarters - Q's Lab

James Bond enters Q's lab, where Q is working on a new gadget.

**Q:** Ah, 007, just in time. I have something special for your next mission.

**Bond:** (smirking) I hope it's not another exploding pen, Q.

**Q:** Very funny, Bond. This is a TV, it's just like 30 other TVs completely indistinguishable to the TV you purchased last week.

**Bond:** (examining the gadget) hmm, I'm not sure I've heard of "XangTech", is this a new special branch?

**Q:** sort of. Fine. How about this shirt?

**Bond:** Sounds useful. And what's the twist?

**Q:** It's also designed by an unpronounceable name shipped directly from china and comes in Asian sizes and poor grammatical description that it looks like an exact copy of 37,000 other items using the same photoshopped picture. Might be a tight fit.

**Bond:** (chuckles) Perfect, what else?

**Q:** Right. we can also give you the machine that shows you what other agents usually buy. No Martinis so not relevant to you, Bond.

**Bond:** (smiling) A delightful touch, Q.

**M:** (nodding) You're right Q, keeping an eye on adversaries is necessary, Bond, and it'll be easier if you weren't half-sozzled all the time.

**Bond:** (smiling) Just doing my part for the services economy and country M.

**M:** Bond... be careful with your shopping habits.

**Q:** (to M) at least he pays taxes.
