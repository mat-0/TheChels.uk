title: PRACTICE coaching Model

---

## Problem identification (P)

In the first step of the model, the goal is to clarify the client’s problem. In addition to this problem clarification, this is also the phase during which the coach takes their time to really understand their client. Various questions can help in gaining this clarity and understanding:

- What would you like to talk about today?
- What exactly is the problem?
- What are the implications of this problem?
- How will you notice your problem has been resolved?
- On a scale of 1 to 10, how capable do you feel able to solve the problem yourself?

## Realistic and relevant objectives (R)

The second phase of the PRACTICE coaching model revolves around developing relevant and specific objectives related to the previously identified problem. It is possible to use the SMART objectives for this, but not necessarily. However, make sure the objectives follow the most important SMART criteria. Questions that can help during this phase include:

What does the client hope to gain from the sessions?
Is this objective realistic, measurable, etc?

## Alternative solutions (A)

The third phase of the PRACTICE coaching model represents the ability to identify a wide range of alternative solutions. Solutions, in this sense, are meant to be those that actually guide the client to their identified goal. This phase of the process cannot be rushed. The main question should be: and what else? The more possible solutions that can be identified, the better.

- What are my options?
- And what else?

## Consequences (C)

The fourth phase of the PRACTICE coaching model revolves around considering the consequences associated with each of the previously identified solutions. In this phase, research what could happen after the implementation of certain solutions. Consequences can be both positive and negative, and both should be explored. The more solutions considered, the more informed a decision can be made. In this phase, use a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being very ineffective and 10 extremely effective.

Ask yourself the following question:

To what extent are the solutions effective?

## Target best feasible option (T)

In this fifth phase of the model, the focus lies on the most feasible options. What distinguishes one viable option from another? What is the best option for my client? Which is the most practical? Include as many factors as possible that can influence the feasibility of the solutions. Are they resources? Time? Chances and opportunities? Risks and dangers?

Other questions that can be asked are:

- Does my client feel comfortable with this solution?
- What other options would you like to explore?

## Implementation of the chosen solution (I)…

The sixth and almost last phase of the model revolves around implementing the solution chosen in the previous step. Essentially, this means that the solution is divided into smaller pieces that can more easily be implemented into a step-by-step plan. This process needs to be led by the client. This is important because the client will eventually implement the solution during the last step.

## Evaluation (E)

During the last phase of the coaching process, it is assessed whether the implementation of the solution, and therefore the entire coaching process, was a success or not. In this phase, we, again, use a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being very unsuccessful and 10 extremely successful. This phase is also meant to reflect on how the process went and whether the client is on the right track to achieve their goals. It is up to the coach to determine whether the client needs everything in order to achieve success in the future.

Questions that may take on a central role during the evaluation phase include:

- How successful was this period?
- Please give a mark between 1 and 10.
- What did you learn from this period?
- Does the client need more coaching?
- Is there another problem that should be discussed?
