> The team’s the thing
> “Be ruthless with systems, be kind with people” - Michael Brooks

> Delivering high-quality software is a team sport, and we need to support each other. We should be aspiring to set up our workplace such that psychological safety and non-violent communication are first-class concerns rather than nice-to-haves.
> 
> Work together, challenge the systems that make doing that hard, build an environment where good software is a natural outcome rather than a goal.
> 
> tl;dr
> - Identify where the value is.
> - Do those things first.
> - Optimise your delivery for fast feedback.
> - Challenge things that hinder you.
