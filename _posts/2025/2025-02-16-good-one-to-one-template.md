title: GOOD one-to-one template

---

Managers and employees should have a one-to-one conversation on at least a monthly basis. I prefer fortnightly. This optional template provides a guide for managers and employees to provide structure to the conversation.

- Manager Name:
- Employee Name:
- Date of meeting:

## Goals

* What objectives are you working towards?
* What have you achieved since the last meeting?

## Obstacles

* What might get in your way of meeting your goals?
  * time
  * resources
  * knowledge
  * confidence
  * health

## Opportunities

* What can you and I do to help overcome the obstacles?
* What could we do to make your role more fulfilling?

## Decisions

* What actions have we agreed on?
* How will we know that we are making progress?
