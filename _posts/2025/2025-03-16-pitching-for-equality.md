Mentioned on the BBC regarding the quality of the pitch for the Women's League Cup final at Pride Park, 15th March 2025.

16th March, the Men's cup final is at Wembley.

> Embarrassing for a major cup final to be on a pitch this bad. That Chelsea left back area looks like pure mud. Rest of the pitch isn't much better.
