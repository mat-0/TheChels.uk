title: Optimising for Alignment

- We work in two-week cycles
- We constantly refine our backlog as a breakdown of our roadmap and additional work items (e.g. bugs, technical debt, process improvements).
- We have a golden thread from `Company objectives -> Roadmap Items (Epics) -> Features -> Stories -> Tasks`
- We plan the cycle around a single _goal_ That is a deliverable piece of value to our customers, we commit to deliver a number of work items to achieve that goal and prioritise these work items over everything else.
