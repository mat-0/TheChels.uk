> Substack sent a push alert encouraging users to subscribe to a Nazi newsletter that claimed Jewish people are a sickness and that we must eradicate minorities to build a “White homeland.”
>
> NatSocToday describes itself as “a weekly newsletter featuring opinions and news important to the National Socialist and White Nationalist Community.”
>
> The push alert was sent to an undisclosed number of users’ phones on Monday. Some people posted about the app alert on social media, confused why they were being prompted to subscribe to a Nazi blog
