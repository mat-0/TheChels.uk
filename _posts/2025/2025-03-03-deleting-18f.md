> 18F was not a drain on taxpayer dollars — it was a self-funded organization operating on a cost-recovery model. Government agencies chose to work with 18F and paid for their services because they delivered exceptional value. The claim that eliminating 18F serves “efficiency” is not just wrong — it’s a deliberate misrepresentation of how the organization actually functioned.
