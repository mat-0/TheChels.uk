title: Diagnosis

Last week my GP confirmed a diagnosis of ME CFS. 

I've been off work since July and I've used my Mac for less than an hour in those several months. Basically to do a computer only task, and updating it. 

Updates will be sporadic and will utilise some automations and workflows built on my phone (Drafts, Pythonista, Working Copy).

Apologies for any typos. Cognitive decline overwhelms
