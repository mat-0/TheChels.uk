title: Seven Coaching Questions

---

Here are seven questions to ask during each coaching session.

> Taken from the book "The Coaching Habit: Say Less, Ask More & Change the Way You Lead Forever" by Michael Bungay Stanier

Coaching should be simple and question-oriented: spend more time listening and less time talking. There is a reason we have two ears and one mouth - we need to listen twice as much as we talk.

- What's on your mind?
- And what else?
- What's the real challenge here?
- What do you want?
- How can I help?
- If you're saying yes to this, what are you saying no to.
- What was most useful for you?
