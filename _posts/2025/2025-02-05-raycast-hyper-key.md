title: Raycast Adds Hyperkey
---

Finally, Spotlight replacement and all round productivity app, [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) has added a hyperkey.

Hyperkey is a shortcut and replaces the combination of shift, control, alt and command. i.e., pressing one key over all four modifiers.

This great for programming specific key combinations e.g. I use `hyperkey H` to go to my home page. `hyperkey 1` to got to 1Password in all the aim of improving productivity - spending more time with hands on the keyboard.
