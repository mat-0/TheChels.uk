> here are so many reasons to be excited about WIRED’s future. But it’s important to recognize that we’re doing this work within an information ecosystem that’s transforming before our eyes: The platforms on which outlets like WIRED used to connect with readers, listeners, and viewers are failing in real time; Facebook traffic disappeared years ago, and now Google Search is dwindling as the company reorients users to rely on AI Overviews instead of links to credible publishers. More and more users are also skipping Google altogether, opting to use chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude to find information they once relied on news outlets for. Meanwhile, AI-generated slop and mis- and disinformation are seeping into the internet’s every pore, polluting social media feeds and drowning out news and human-driven storytelling.
> 
> At WIRED, our solution to this so-called “traffic apocalypse,” and the AI sloppification of the internet, is simple: connect our humans to all of you humans.
> 
> Here’s the plan: We’ll continue to produce top-tier journalism and storytelling, from written stories, scoops, features, and interviews to podcasts and audio narration, to bite-size videos and livestreams. And we’re inviting you to join us, directly on WIRED.com or in your inbox, with a new subscription offering that we think is more dynamic, more engaging, and more valuable. Most of all, we’re increasingly focused on creating a community and a shared conversation between WIRED journalists and all of you—our audience of curious, brilliant, future-focused people around the world. We want to answer your questions and solicit your input and ideas. We want to know what scares you, what excites you, and what we can do to help you navigate this strange new future.
