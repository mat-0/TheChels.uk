Some good personal Kanban one piece flow

> Most importantly:
> 
> GTD-style “if it takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately.”
> Create todos for everything (and I mean, everything, including replying to people) that go into Inbox.
> Always inbox zero across Slack/email/etc. Respond to slack messages/emails/etc. with “On my todo list to reply, will get back to you”.
> Every morning sit down and prioritize todos that are in the Inbox into the Backlog. (and reprioritize existing Backlog list if it’s changed)
> 
> Rarely (if never) do todos that you just created in the Inbox.
> 
> Whenever I’m not in a meeting, open todo list and do top Backlog item.
> Kanban board with five columns: Inbox, Backlog, Blocked, Delegated, Done
