title: Castro adds device sync
cited: Castro

---

> Castro is launching device sync today along with an iPad app. Sync is part of the existing Castro Plus subscription, with no additional charge or pricing changes. All aspects of the feature are opt-in and can be enabled or disabled at any time. If you would prefer separate profiles on your phone and your iPad, that's totally fine, nothing changes for you. For everyone else, you can finally have a full-screen experience on all your devices and transition between them seamlessly. 
> 
> This release is a big deal for us. These are our two most requested features, and I believe they fill the biggest gaps in our offering so we're very excited to get it out.
