> Imagine you worked like this:
>
> At the start of the week: Get together with the team to decide what to ship—bring live—at the end of the week. Ideally, everyone contributes, but this is intentionally not a requirement.
>
> At the end of the week: Get together and look at what was shipped. Everyone high-fives or, together, lands on one lesson to learn.
