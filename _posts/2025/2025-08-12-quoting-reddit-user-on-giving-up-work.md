Reddit user on giving up work

> One clue was spending about half of my summer holidays asleep and the other half resting and still not feeling recovered from a busy time at work after two weeks of doing that. 
> 
> The other clue was the increasing symptoms that seemed to pop up out of nowhere: near constant headaches, palpitations, lightheadedness, brain fog, insomnia, lack of appetite, a nagging nervous/anxious energy and having migraines (i.e. PEM crashes) nearly every weekend. I also fell asleep anytime I wasn't working or actively doing something else and even had to take lunchtime naps to get through my days. 
> 
> I didn't put it all together with my prior covid infections for ages, because initially my threshold for PEM was quite high (I only crashed after really intense workouts) and I assumed my new migraines were caused by working too much after starting a new job. 
> 
> I figured, maybe I was burned out and quit my job to look for something with a better work life balance, but my symptoms still kept getting worse until I was referred to a post covid clinic and learned about pacing.Â 
> 
> Knowing what I know now, I'd recommend to stop working before it gets to that point.
