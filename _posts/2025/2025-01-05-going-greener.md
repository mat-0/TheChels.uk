title: Going Greener - Electric Vehicle and Solar Panel Setup
---

On the verge of an acquiring a full electric EV for the wife. I don't drive, installing a EV charger to compliment this.

Having 10 solar panels and a 5kw battery installed too.

Next would be some insulating cladding. A heat pump and new radiator as well as a new kitchen and transitioning to a fully electric home with a high EPC rating and low cost energy needs.

Given I've never driven, have taken only a few flights in my lifetime, recycle well, I must be close to being carbon neutral.

What next?
