Did a bit of cross training this week, with the bank holiday taking the family swimming - this was good recovery for some tired legs
the Birmingham 10km was a difficult course and the constant undulation left me with some leg and glute pain.

First run of the week was an easy commute home on Wednesday

Thursday I took some time out in the afternoon in the heat and ran 4.5 miles with a friend and added another 0.4 miles back to the office

Saturday I did the shortest of warm ups and cool downs, as again it was very hot, either side of a parkrun. I tweaked a knee after the first mile so eased off considerably to get round.

Sunday I ran 9 miles easy and then did 6x hill repeats, probably around 100m in 22-25 second range.

I'm into June now and have clocked over 510 miles. So well on pace to complete 1000. I have the Cheltenham Challenge 10km (June 16th) and the Leamington Spa half (July 7th) coming up soon

* 1.6 mile easy commute
* 5 miles easy
* 5.2 miles including sub 24:00 minute parkrun
* 9.8 miles easy long run and hill workout
