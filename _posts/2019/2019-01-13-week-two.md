Week two saw a slight decrease in mileage to 21.6 miles, due to a busy sunday with family,
I moved the long run to Saturday and ran to and then volunteered at my local parkrun in the morning then straight into 7.5 miles long run. In Hindsight this was a mistake as i'd been up since 7am and didn't start running until 10am and as I normally run fasted I was pretty hungry mid-run and struggled with stomach cramps.

* 3.2 miles - easy
* 6.5 miles - commute - easy
* 2.9 miles - easy
* 8.8 miles - 1.3 easy + 7.5 long run
