After picking up a cold or the flu during the week and celebrating my daughter's third birthday my overall mileage for week was low. Totalling 6.5 miles. Friday I ran to and from work to play some poker (and won). Sunday I did a little 4 mile progression run from easy in to tempo

* 2.4 miles - easy
* 4.1 miles - progression.
