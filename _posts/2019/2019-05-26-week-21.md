title: Week 21 - Reduced Mileage for Birmingham 10K Prep

Reduced mileage this week as I prepared for the Birmingham 10km.

Monday was the charity work run, I contributed 10.1 miles towards our target of 100 miles.
The group ended up completing 160 miles raising around Â£300 for Acorns Hospice

Saturday I did a short warmup and an easy parkrun before travelling up to Birmingham

Sunday I ran the SimplyHealth Great Birmingham 10km, clocking in 48:00 on an undulating and
difficult course. If the course was flat and without headwind up the biggest hill I feel I
could have got a PB.

* 10.1 miles - mostly easily
* 4.9 miles - easy commute
* 6.8 miles - 10km race and a small commute home.
