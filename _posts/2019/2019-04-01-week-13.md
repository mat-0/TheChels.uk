Back to running on a Monday again. The run felt good albeit short covering just 2.5 miles.

Work/home life took over this week, so wasn't able to get out on Wednesday but did manage an easy 4.2 miles on thursday followed by my long run on the friday morning, having had a days leave to spend a long weekend with family, I clocked 8.5 miles.

Taking my total for the 3 months to over 300 miles.

* 2.5 miles - easy
* 4.2 miles - easy
* 8.5 miles - easy
