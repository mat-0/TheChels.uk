Week began on Tuesday with 4.45 miles at a steady pace with only a 3 second margin between paces on the first 4 miles.

Wednesday and Friday were both direct run commutes home, work has been intense for a while now and that hampers the ability to squeeze in runs before daughter's bed time

Saturday I ran to parkrun, did a pleasing 22:41, a cool down on the way back and then did a lap of the local park too totally 8.9 miles for the day.

Sunday was the usual long run clocking in 9.1 miles with a fast last mile and using the .1 of a mile to cool down.

Total for the week was 25 miles bang on my target.

* 4.4 miles - steady run
* 1.2 miles - run commute
* 1.2 miles - run commute
* 8.9 miles - commuting to parkrun, Parkrun, and a couple of cool downs back
* 9.1 miles - faster finish long run
