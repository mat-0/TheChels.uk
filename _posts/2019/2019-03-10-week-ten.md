Starting the week as per usual with a 5.4 mile run commute home via Pittville park - nice and easy but with quite strong winds. Legs were quite heavy after the weekend's efforts. It was also my 36th birthday.

Family commitments meant I wasn't able to run Wednesday or Thursday, but was able to squeeze in a 2 mile run to work and back for an important meeting at tempo pace.

Saturday I volunteered to be tail walker at ParkRun taking the daughter with me, so the wife could have a well deserved/needed lie-in after a night out for her birthday. I walked around 8 miles in total which is worth recording here, but doesn't factor in to my goal.

I went for an afternoon 5.5 miles easy run, followed by 7.9 miles on the Sunday in the wind.

* 5.4 miles - easy commute
* 2.0 miles - tempo commute
* 5.5 miles - easy
* 7.9 miles - long run
