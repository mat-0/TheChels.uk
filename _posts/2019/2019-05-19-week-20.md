Reduced mileage this week as I have a charity running event on the Monday (20th May) where i intend to run 12 miles -
so I skipped this week's long run.

Tuesday I ran 4 miles in the evening after a long day at work, 4 miles easy
followed by 4x 2 minutes on 1 min recovery workout. the 2 minute blocks were run at 6:40 pace, very fast for me

Wednesday I did a short run commute home

Thursday I ran to the local running track to pay for the charity event and ran back to work

I put in a great effort on Saturday at parkrun clocking in at 21:55, my first time sub 22 minutes and a PB by 29 seconds and first PB at 5km since December 2017

Race day on the 26th.

* 5.4 miles - 4 miles easy and 1.4 miles workout
* 1.6 miles - easy commute
* 2.4 miles - easy
* 8.0 miles - commuting to parkrun, parkrun, and a longer cool down.
