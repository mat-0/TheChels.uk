After picking up an injury during the Cheltenham half, I took most of the week off and did lots of RICE.

Some new shoes arrived on Thursday, and feeling better I did a short loop of 1.3 miles in the heavy rain to see how the quad was holding up.

Saturday was a friend's 100th parkrun and having already committed to volunteering at my local I ran to and from the other parkrun so clocked 8.7 miles on the day.

Sunday was my mum's birthday so we met up for some family time and clocked 3 walking miles. But this meant no long run - with my intention to pick this up on Monday.

* 1.3 miles - easy run
* 8.7 miles - park run and warm up and down
