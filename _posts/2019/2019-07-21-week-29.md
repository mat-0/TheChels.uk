Back to the monday runs this week, joining the striders for a club run of 6.3 miles and 0.7 miles warm up. nice and easy on a cross country and hilly route.

Wednesday was the speed session, which involved:

- 4x 4 minutes @ 10km pace, 1 minute active recovery
- 4x 2 minutes @ 1 mile pace, 1 minute active recovery
- 4x 1 minute @ 800 metre pace with 30 seconds recovery

I ended up clocking around 6 minute miling for the quicker sessions working really hard.

Saturday I ran to and did parkrun for a total of 4.8 miles.

Next week I begin half marathon training for Cheltenham.

- 7.0 miles - easy club run
- 6.4 miles - workout
- 4.8 miles - warmup and parkrun
