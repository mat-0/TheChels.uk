> Jesus and Moses are playing golf

> Moses hits the ball for a perfect 300 yard drive right down the middle of the fairway.

> Jesus swings and chips the ball far left and lands in the branches of a tree. Suddenly, the wind picks up and it begins to rain so hard that a river forms in the middle of the course. The ball floats down the river when a fish jumps up to bite the ball. But, at the same moment, a bald eagle flies down grabs the fish with the ball in its mouth flies over the green and the fish drops the ball right in, for a hole in one.

> Moses looks at Jesus and says "Do you wanna play golf or do you wanna fuck around?!"
