On Wednesday I was again at the CLC Striders speed session which included:

* 2 lap warm up and drills 
* Indian running 
* 4x 2.5 mins @ 10km pace 90 sec rec. 
* 4x 75 sec @ 5km pace 60 sec rec.

Saturday I ran to and from parkrun and clocked a time of 23:36 on my 77th parkrun. 

Again another reduced mileage week as I take a well earned rest ahead of ramping up for half marathon training.

* 5.1 miles - workout
* 6.1 miles - warmup, cooldown and parkrun
