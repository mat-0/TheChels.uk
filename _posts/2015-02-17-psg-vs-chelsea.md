#### PSG vs Chelsea: The Fans View

The Champions League knockout stages comprise of some of the most highly anticipated games of the season. Ahead of this evening's stand-out tie between PSG and Chelsea, we spoke with @1970_PSG who runs http://1970psg.com and @ChelseaStats who runs http://thechels.co.uk to find out their views on the game, and help UFL users out with some top tips!

#### Are you happy with how your season has gone so far?

@1970_PSG: It has been a strange old season to be honest. We are in an envious position of still being in all four competitions – a Coupe de la Ligue Final already booked – but there has been a number of issues we have had to contend with. Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s injury problems have seen a dip in form from him. The play is way too rigid at times. For all our possession in games we lack bite in the final third. The whole debacle surrounding Edinson Cavani and Ezequiel Lavezzi was not helpful, nor was the comments from Thiago Motta’s agent about a possible move. And then there is the constant scrutiny which Laurent Blanc is under.

Thankfully though, in the last few weeks we have seen an upturn. The team is playing well, we are in a good run of form, some of our senior players (such as Thiago Silva and Motta) are finding their level again and there is a feel good factor which we have lacked for the last few months. It has come at the perfect time with Chelsea on the horizon.

@ChelseaStats: Great. We've had a couple of poor performances and dropped a few points, but we've been excellent in the big games and look comfortable at the top of the table. We've been top all season, nobody can complain if that continues right through to the final day.

#### Who’s been your star player this season?

@1970_PSG: Javier Pastore. For a player who looked as if he was going to be moved on last summer, his form has been a pleasant surprise. He is without doubt, along with Lucas Moura, PSG’s most dependable outlet in attack. He is involved in everything, making things happen! He has been a revelation and has at long last turned his career around in Paris which is a joy to see.

@ChelseaStats: This is quite a difficult one, as lots of players have performed well and at an excellent level for spells. Willian recently, but Costa and Fabregas have settled in so well too. There's Oscar and Hazard, but for me it's Petr Cech. He lost his place in the team, but never spoke out, has always been professional and when he has played he's made some excellent saves and kept us in games. I'd rate Petr Cech as the second best keeper in the world behind Neuer, Courtois third.

#### Who is the 'One to Watch' for this game?

@1970_PSG: One of Paris Saint-Germain's most underrated players is Blaise Matuidi, he is the engine in the three man midfield. Marco Verratti and Thiago Motta control the play in the middle of the park where as Matuidi will use his energy to bomb forward to assist the attackers. He does not get many goals but we are far more dynamic when he is in the team. The French international is crucial to this PSG side.

@ChelseaStats: Branislav Ivanovic, He's scored a couple of crucial goals recently and I'd expect him to threaten from set pieces against a injury hit PSG. I'd expect much of the focus to be on Eden Hazard, however.

#### Which PSG player should be avoided?

@1970_PSG: If he starts, Gregory Van der Wiel. Usually so dependable, the Dutchman has hit a poor run of form which has seen him concede a penalty in a 4-2 defeat and score an own goal. That led to him being dropped for Marquinhos who will most probably start ahead of him having impressed there.

#### Which Chelsea player should be avoided?

@ChelseaStats: I think everyone has been performing well so perhaps Gary Cahill is the one that stands out, having had a couple of moments that have exposed his pace and his tendency to back away from strikers. I wouldn't mind seeing Kurt Zouma start as he continues to grow and it'd be a fantastic experience for him.

#### What is your score prediction for the first leg and the tie overall?

@1970_PSG: PSG need a result here to take back to Stamford Bridge but I can see Chelsea scoring at least a goal. I am going for 2-1 to Paris.

@ChelseaStats: I think a 2-1 Chelsea win away. 3-1 at home and so 5-2 on aggregate. I think we did enough last time against them and we are stronger, quicker and more of a team now so can only see one winner.
