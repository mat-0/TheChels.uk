Introducing green

Big fan of the [slash pages](https://slashpages.net) "movement" in the IndieWeb seen such that I would like to introduce my own suggestion.

[/green](/green)

A page for authors/website owners to share their work towards the environment and decarbonisation.

There are a number of free tools that estimate the carbon footprint of websites which can be added to the site, as well listing other green or sustainable solutions.
