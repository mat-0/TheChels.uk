Started with a New Years Day double parkrun, my local Cheltenham parkrun was not running an official one, so I did it on my own around 08:00am, then off to Gloucester City for 10:30. followed by an easy run commute Wednesday and 5.4 miles Thursday which include 3.1 miles on the track. 5.5 miles on Saturday, including 3.1 parkrun. The week ended with an 8 mile long run.

* 8 miles - warmup/down and 2 parkruns - steady
* 3.2 miles - commute - easy
* 5.4 miles - warmup/down + track speedwork
* 5.5 miles - warmup/down and parkrun
* 8.0 miles - long run
