####Chelsea vs Everton

Chelsea are dominant at home and have still not lost a league game at the Bridge under Mourinho (won 57 drawn 16). Everton beat us at Goodison earlier in the season, so Chelsea will look to avenge that result. Chelsea haven't lost at home to Everton in the league since 1994 but also haven't kept a clean sheet against them for 13 games. Chelsea to win 2-1.

####Cardiff and Hull 

Cardiff look poor and haven't had the boost a new manager brings on the flip side Hull have boosted their strike force and that looks to be Shrewd business. Cardiff have won just 4 of their 16 games against sides outside the big 7 this season. Hull have won 6. I think Hull will be too strong and win 0-2

####West Brom vs Fulham

Mel's Baggies aren't quite there yet but credible draws against Everton, Liverpool and Chelsea suggest they are good enough to survive, they've won just 3 of 16 games against sides outside the big 7, the worst record in the league. Fulham are in all sorts of trouble. West Brom 2-0.

####C Palace vs Man Utd

Utd are where they are and it's not surprising really. The attacking 4 or 5 are fine, but they struggle in midfield and defence and the squad looks short. Palace have been solid under Pulis and I had predicted they would upset a big team at some point this season. This I think will be their day. 1-0.

####Arsenal vs Sunderland

Arsenal will bounce back from their disappointment against Bayern and although i think Sunderland are better under Poyet, Arsenal will be too strong. Giroud has had a rest and will be the difference. 2-0.

####Man City vs Stoke

The 2011 Cup final. Hughes back at his former club. Man City like Arsenal will bounce back and although goals have dried up  a little in recent games they will be back to their best this time. Stoke have lost all 5 games away from home against the big teams, and although they beat Chelsea and Man Utd at home they won't have enough to stop City's fluidity. 5-0.

####West Ham vs Southampton.

Many would think West Ham have turned it around in recent weeks, but the truth is they have had easier games and they are a team good enough to finish around 10th. They have 13 clean sheets this season, but 6 of those were 0-0 draws. Southampton have nothing to play for after their FA Cup loss. West Ham will continue to secure their premier league place but Southampton are decent enough and will score. 2-1.

####Liverpool vs Swansea

Suarez failed to score against Arsenal, yet the team scored 5 and look to be one of the form sides at the moment, I can't help but think they'll pip Arsenal to finish in the top 3. Monk seems like a good fit for Swansea as he gets the club. Is he good enough to keep them in the league and take them to the next level, I'm not sure, regardless they won't get anything in this one. Liverpool 3-0.

####Newcastle vs Aston Villa

Newcastle are another side with nothing left to play for, they've conceded 10 in the last 3 games and have only scored in one of their last 8 games. Villa have won just two of their last 12 and one of those was their cup final against West Brom. I think this has 0-0 written all over it.

####Norwich vs Tottenham

Norwich have won just 1 of their last 11 in the league and Spurs have turned the corner from AVB with Sherwood, like Monk i'm not sure he's the long term solution, but he will keep them in the top 7 this season. Spurs are decent away from home too, with the most wins in the league, they've lost just two and will be too strong for Norwich. 0-2.
