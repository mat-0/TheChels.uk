On holiday in Crete, so a slightly different make up to my runs this week.

Wednesday, 7.1 miles made up from 4.5 miles early morning run and then a recovery slow and steady 2.6 miles in the heat.

Thursday evening 5 miles easy along the coast.

Saturday I attempted 3.1 miles at effort in lieu of a parkrun clocking in at just over 25 minutes in 26 degree heat

* 7.2 miles easy
* 5.0 miles easy
* 3.1 miles effort
