More and more in my career I have to come to appreciate the following:

1. Making work as small as possible but no smaller.
2. Working together; in an ensemble/mob.
3. TDD.
4. Trunk-based development (with short-lived feature branches)
5. Minimal CD.
6. Treating people as human beings; be kind and candid.
7. Trust.
8. Focus on user needs.
9. Having fun.
10. Exploration and learning over following a detailed plan.

Get these things right in your engineering team and almost anything is possible.
