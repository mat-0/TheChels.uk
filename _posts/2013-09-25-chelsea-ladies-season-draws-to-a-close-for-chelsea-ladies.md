The season draws to a close for Chelsea Ladies this weekend with just a home game to Lincoln to finish up what has been a difficult campaign.

The Ladies have endured a difficult month or so, having lost out to Arsenal 1-0 before being beaten by Lincoln away 2-0 and defeats followed against Birmingham 3-2 and Bristol 3-1 in a terrible run of form that has seen the club lose 10 of 11, with a 4-0 victory over bottom of the table Doncaster the only success.

Sofia Jakobsson and Ester Dos Santos have both been sold to Coppenburg in Germany, ahead of the German league campaign. Chelsea Ladies reported the transfer fee represented good business for the club, albeit undisclosed. This has seen the likes of Jodie Brett and Rosella Ayane, who scored the Chelsea goal against Bristol, earn more valuable minutes and experience in what is the last fawsl season without a standard relegation and therefore no real risk.


Jakobsson will be considered a significant loss, as the clubs top scorer this season in all competitions, perhaps given more time Ogimi can add goals next season to boost Aluko and Ward’s tally. Ester’s departure has seen more minutes for Spence and Coombs in midfield and although results have been disappointing they have largely been in keeping with the post mid-season slumps written about previously so there is nothing to suggest a loss of quality on the pitch.

It has always been the club’s philosophy under Emma Hayes to produce a long-standing structure to women’s football from Cobham and the promotion of youth players into the first team is testament to the good work happening at the centre of excellence and in the development teams.

The only real difference in the fawsl this season was the fact Liverpool were able to take their ladies on a full time basis, this opportunity saw them take a couple of players from local rivals Everton and Matt Beard’s appointment paved the way for Gemma Bonner, now captain, Quantrill and Longhurst to leave Chelsea for Merseyside. Liverpool will win the league if they avoid defeat to challengers Bristol on the final day.

In summary, there are lots of positives to take from this season, but plenty of work to do in the off season.

The Chelsea Ladies Development team kick off their season on the 6th of October away at Bristol.
