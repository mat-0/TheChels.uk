Last time I posted on this blog I had just run 1000 miles and completed my challenge. I ended the year on just over 1200 miles and raised well over Â£1000 for the charity.

I have since applied for and taken a new role in my company as head of software development, I have been incredibly busy doing this and dealing with family life, that the blog has just frozen in time.

I have been working on my GitHub repositories recently and found a way to include my latest blog posts on my [profile readme](https://github.com/Mat-0) and so this is largely a post to check that it works!
