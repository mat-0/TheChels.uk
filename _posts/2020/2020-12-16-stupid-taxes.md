1. Anything that doesn't help you towards your goals is a tax on your time (e.g fictional TV)
2. Branded items are a tax on status, self-esteem, and not a tax on quality
2. Renewals on subscriptions or direct debits (energy, insurance etc.) are a tax on laziness - shop around
3. The lottery is tax for those unable to do maths
4. Full price items are a tax on laziness - use price comparison, discount or cash back sites
6. Late nights and long days at work are a tax on your recovery, performance, and wellbeing.
7. Unnecessary possessions are a tax on time, space, and money - only buy what you need and can afford
8. Credit (debt) - is a tax on your financial freedom
